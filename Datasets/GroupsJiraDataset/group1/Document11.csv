61974,,,,,,,,bulk close for 3.4,Committed for trunk and 3.x,Attaching final patch which will be committed shortly. Added better error handling.,Jan: +1,Has anyone got around to inspecting this patch? I'd like to get this into 3.3.,Bulk move 3.2 -> 3.3,Marking fo 3.2 since patch is ready,Hey Jan - putting this on my to-do list in the case that someone does not beat me to it. You have a variety of issues out there that I'd like to get to I think - sorry for the delay. You have been a fantastic addition to the project.,Anyone fancy testing this and consider for commit?,This new patch bumps version number to 1.4 and adds examples to the help of how to post csv; json and pdf,The solution was simple. Change the commit() method to do ?commit=true instead of posting as '<commit/>' Also cleaned up dead meat; added a -Doptimize=yes option and accepts -h and --help in addition to -help,It might not be a bug according to the original design intentions. But the first thing we tell users is to try out post.jar to post stuff; and now we've even included csv and json examples for it. Then it's unnecessary to get the error 'Solr returned an error #400 undefined field <commit/>' thrown in your face - the error does not even explain the problem. I'll try to assemble a first patch for this next week some time; adding a separate POST with ?commit=true after the last file is POSTed.,part of the reason it works the way it does now is that when commit=true it POSTs a single commit at the end of multiple file POSTs; if we use the param based commit it would either need to specify commit on all of them; or keep track of the last one only add the param there. Although only adding a 'commit' on the last update should be easy; we could also just do it via the URL. I believe posting '?commit=true' to update handlers w/o a body works?,post.jar has hardcoded assumptions about what URL you want to hit and how it should behave ‰ÛÒ if you want to change those assumptions there are documented params for changing it. -Durl=... and -Dcommit=false. if you want to post to something that isn't the XmlRequestHandler; you should specify -Dcommit=false; and then you can follow that with an explicit execution to commit... java -Durl=... -jar post.jar *.cssv java -jar post.jar part of the reason it works the way it does now is that when commit=true it POSTs a single commit at the end of multiple file POSTs; if we use the param based commit it would either need to specify commit on all of them; or keep track of the last one only add the param there. i don't object to changing post.jar to use a commit request param instead of sending the XML form; but this isn't a bug ‰ÛÒ it's working as it was intended.,Assume that all UpdateRequestHandlers support a GET parameter commit=true I think we should assume this; and fix anything where it doesn't work.,How would post.jar know the URL of the XmlUpdateRequestHandler? A) We could assume .*/solr/update as 99% would not modify the defaults? Or B) Assume that all UpdateRequestHandlers support a GET parameter commit=true In that case; we could append '?commit=true' to the given URL. I know for a fact that '/solr/update/csv?commit=true' will work,The commit could be snet at the end as a single xml document in a separate request if the content type of data is different.,Example:  lap:exampledocs janhoy$ java -Durl=http://localhost:8983/solr/update/csv -jar post.jar books.csv SimplePostTool: version 1.3 SimplePostTool: POSTing files to http://localhost:8983/solr/update/csv.. SimplePostTool: POSTing file books.csv SimplePostTool: COMMITting Solr index changes.. SimplePostTool: FATAL: Solr returned an error #400 undefined field <commit/>  The commit should be sent in a different way; problem is how to know where and how to send the commit in case of non-standard URLs; such as http://localhost:8983/solr/my/custom/updatehandler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18736,,,x,x,,,,You miss some logic: var e = Wicket.$(id); available++; if (e === null) { i.e. if there is an entry for a date picker in the DOM but there is no HTML element for it then the DOM entry is deleted too.,If I understand the patch correctly; you destroy all calendar instances at the end of any ajax activity on the page? E.g. when I have two calendars and select date in one of them; the other one will not even open when clicked?,Martin; I have thought of something like this. åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊvar destroyInternal = function (toDestroy) { if (toDestroy && toDestroy.length > 1) { var i = 0; while (toDestroy.length > 0) { var name = toDestroy.pop(); try { if (YAHOO.wicket[name]) { // this is expensive. YAHOO.wicket[name].destroy(); delete YAHOO.wicket[name]; } } catch (e) { if (Wicket.Log) { Wicket.Log.error(e); } } i++; if (i === 20) { break; } } if(toDestroy.length > 0) { setTimeout(function(){destroyInternal(toDestroy);}; 500); } } }; So move the åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊif(toDestroy.length > 0) { setTimeout(function(){destroyInternal(toDestroy);}; 500); } out of the cycle. The 500 above is because YAHOO.wicket[name].destroy(); seems to be very expensive and if done 'in one go' browser might 'freeze'. Do you know a better way to prevents that? The if (Wicket.DateTime.isDestroying) was a leftover of trying to make this script 'single instance at a time'.,The JSLint warning is solved.,I've pushed an improved version of your patch. Please test that I didn't break it. I've made the functions private. Is there a reason they should be reachable from other scripts ? Additionally I see : if (Wicket.DateTime.isDestroying) { There is no property Wicket.DateTime.isDestroying defined. I guess it should be set in #destroy() and unset in #internalDestroy() ? And grunt reports one jslint warning: Linting wicket-datetime/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/extensions/yui/calendar/wicket-date.js...ERROR [L349:C71] Don't make functions within a loop. åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊsetTimeout(function(){destroyInternal(toDestroy);}; 5); Do you see a way to avoid it ?,"'""JavaScript only' patch""",No; we haven't measured 1.5 vs. 6.x. I've used jsperf.com to decide what jQuery solution to use for some particular need in 6.x.,Martin; Yes you are right... that would be a much cleaner solution. So register an '/ajax/call/complete' listener that calls Wicket.DateTime.destroy(). I derived this solution form a private extension of DatePicker (for 1.4.x) that does more things: e.g. collect all all info of all date pickers to be added (in an AJAX request cycle) and issue a single eval to build all of them... which is far more efficient than many evaluations (at least on 1.4.x). So; it was just a matter of adding the additional 'cleaner code' to listener. I will add a new patch with suggested solution. By the way. On the sample projects attached AJAX repainting of the whole table for 6.x takes less than 1 second (steadily; even without the clean up fix) while for 1.5.x it takes t > 7 with t growing with each table navigation. Do you have measured how much faster is AJAX on wicket 6.x than on previous versions (on average)? Cheers. Ernesto,Isn't is better to use a global listener that triggers on '/ajax/call/complete' and checks for existence for the date picker DOM element and if not - removes all JS objects related to it ? Something like https://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/master/wicket-core/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/ajax/res/js/wicket-ajax-jquery.js#L2495 I find it much simpler.,patch for 6.0.x,quickstart for 1.5.x,quickstart for 6.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12357,,,x,x,,,,You are mixing runtimes. You must link _all_ executables with the same run- time library. For release; it's Multithreaded DLL; for debug; it's Debug Multithreaded DLL. Otherwise; bad things will happen when memory allocated from one heap is freed in another. I rebuilt your code with the appropriate setting; and everything worked fine. See the project settings dialog box; C/C++ tab; and the 'Code generation' category.,Created an attachment (id=8494) I have removed some additional headers (extfnapi.h) and other files no longer required.,Created an attachment (id=8425) There is a readme.txt within the file; this does reproduce exactly what I was seeing in my original problem. My previous attachment was a poor attempt at stripping out code to create a repro that would run on most peoples machines. I ripped out the large fails (which I believe where compiler generated to contain the size of the zip file).,You must call XMLPlatformUtils::Initialize() and XalanTransformer::initialize() before you make any calls into the libraries. Take a look at some of the samples; or the Xalan command line executable source code for more information. There is at least one other bug in your code as well: The variable 'result' is a null pointer; but your code tries to copy data to it.,Created an attachment (id=8299) VC6 project plus files (hopefully everything necessary is included),You can attach your zip file by clicking on the Attachments link just below the Keywords link.,I'm going to transfer this bug to Xalan-C for investigation.

6272,,,,,,,,The problem is not in the SAX parser. The problem occurs if you give the -server flag to the jvm (jdk 1.4/1.3) e.g. java -server <sax parser class> on a really big file. Will cause a stackOverflow. Greg Meagher,I tried to SAX parse a simple xml file <?xml version='1.0' ?> <root> ...around 225MB of text content... </root> with xerces2.0.1 and xerces from CVS but could not reproduce the problem. Please attach a small java program/xml file to reproduce it. You can snip the huge 200MB content in your xml file and add a comment there before attaching .,I'm not using validation and the jdk is 1.3. As far as sample code: I can reproduce this problem with a very large xml file and a character() callback of simpley a return. For Example: If the XML file contained the following: åÊ<DOCUMENT vendor='BlueScooter;Inc.' version='1.0' operation='ADD'> <URL docpoolid='DC1-1' mimetype='text/html' url='http%3A%2F%2Ftest.file.bug134.com%2F/test.html' date='1003867000' size='7881' language='eng'/> <ABSTRACT>NO_ABSTRACT</ABSTRACT> <CONTENT> ....200 M of content. </CONTENT> and the character(char[] buffer; offset; count) {} callback contained simply a return .The stack will overflow almost immediately. Thanks for responding to this bug. If there is more you need please let me know. Greg Meagher,Are you using a schema to validate your instance file?. If yes; are you using large values for min/maxOccurs? If no; please attach your instance file with a sample program to reproduce the error. Also; which jdk/os are you using?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lucene Demo has the same packaging problem like this solr one. It's unrelated to the discussion; if the demo webapp should be removed.,Thanks Roman!,It is not only useless; its as stupid as shipping with rt.jar... It is as wrong as shipping inside war.,I thought about this too; it seems useless to me to ship this.,Oh; we should not add the servlet API lib to the binary release. It is a compile time dependent and is provided by the webapp container where you depoly the demo. We should not ship binary with compile time dependencies.,Looks good! My intention was to only check all Lucene product artifacts (not dependencies and compile time depends); but its a good idea to also find invalid artifacts from other projects. In Solr; of course the example folder must be excluded; too as it contains jetty; too.,+1 to commit mike's latest patch (the test) and Roman's patch (the fix). this should be done in 4.0 branch as well.,Patch; also checking all *.jar in Lucene's binary releases. I had to exclude lucene/demo/lib since it ships servlet-api-2.4.jar. (Should we remove that demo webapp?).,Uwe; good idea: I'll do that.,We should maybe also do the same check on all Lucene-generated jar files?,Very nice.,Patch (against 4.0.x branch) for smokeTestRelease.py. It fails on the 4.0.0 RC with this: Traceback (most recent call last):   File 'dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py'; line 1161; in <module>   File 'dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py'; line 1109; in main   File 'dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py'; line 1151; in smokeTest   File 'dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py'; line 446; in unpack   File 'dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py'; line 558; in verifyUnpacked   File 'dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py'; line 177; in checkSolrWAR RuntimeError: WAR file /l/40x/tmp/unpack/apache-solr-4.0.0/example/webapps/solr.war contains JAR file WEB-INF/lib/javax.servlet-api-3.0.1.jar with illegal class 'javax/servlet/ServletSecurityElement.class',I'll fix smokeTestRelease to check for this ...,+1 to fix this issue!,peek inside the war in smokeTestRelease.py and ensure no servlet-api jars or java./javax. classes inside jars in the war Yeah; I think this would be a general useful addition - a list of regex or specific names for forbidden jars and class names.,Thanks! I'll update the patch shortly to include a test for this.,Roman your patch looks good. smokeTestRelease.py (in the dev-tools/scripts directory) is a way to verify release artifacts. Its like a test for the release packaging itself; so it takes as input a URL containing a release candidate (such as http://s.apache.org/lusolr40rc0); and runs a bunch of tests on the files there and fails if something is wrong. It can also be run against the current code checkout by running 'ant nightly-smoke' from the top-level. The key here is; if we don't test that the war doesn't contain stuff it shouldn't; then the bug could come back for a future release.,Attached is the patch against trunk. When applied to the RC tarball it takes care of the issue. Robert; can you please elaborate on how smokeTestRelease.py relates to build/release? I'm pretty new to SOLR ‰ÛÒ still learning.,I don't see a servlet-api.jar in the 3.6.0 war; but i do see it in 4.0.0 war. Sounds like a mistake that it's in 4.0 AFAIK; it's only for compiling against... the actual servlet container should supply the API/implementation (but I'm not a servlet expert either).,It is definitely a bug to include that jar file. I said it so many times; servlet-api.jar is only a compile time dependecy and may not be in the war. We should fix the packaging tasks; the binary release may also only contain servlet.jar in the example folder next to jetty.,I don't see a servlet-api.jar in the 3.6.0 war; but i do see it in 4.0.0 war. I don't know anything about servlets; and would prefer if someone who knew looked at this; I just want to add my comment to please not commit any fix without a test (peek inside the war in smokeTestRelease.py and ensure no servlet-api jars or java./javax. classes inside jars in the war),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

53284,,,,,,,,Resolved in Version 1.2_QA_B1 . Therefore will be closing the issue,Fixed with moving to the axis2 trunk,The root cause of this is a defect in the Axis2 1.3 ApplicationXMLFormatter which ignores the 'preserve' flag passed in åÊåÊåÊåÊpublic void writeTo(MessageContext messageContext; OMOutputFormat format; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊOutputStream outputStream; boolean preserve) throws AxisFault { The latest Axis2 code seems to have this fix; and thus we will be able to incorporate this only when we switch to the next version of Axis2. Thus I am postponing this issue to be fixed in Synapse 1.2 or later as Synapse 1.1.1 cannot fix this without a binary patch of Axis2,Indika; It might be worthwhile to check whether a response has already been submitted by the HTTP transport and throw a little more informative exception if that is the case. 'Transfer-encoding header already present' may sound a bit too scary and confusing. Oleg,Before sending message to a external endpoint ; synapse make a clone the MessageContext and this clone operation clones the properties ..etc... but it will never clone the SOAPEnvelope (except with in clone mediator and when converting soap11 to soap12 or vise visa .). Because of this; each MessageContext contains reference to the same SOAPEnvelope object. According to the scenario in the above synapse configuration; client send the rest request to the synapse and then synapse call to a rest endpoint. In this scenario; we send the cloned Message to the endpoint asynchronously and continue Message Mediation with the original Message . Each Message Context contains reference to the same SOAPEnvelope. Synapse do the rest call to the external endpoint and also continue message mediation . In the message mediation ; after message coming to the Log mediator ; it tries to log SOAPEnvelope(evaluates toString() method ) and then it throws the AxisFault 'java.util.NoSuchElementException ' . This is happen ; even client make a SOAP call and synapse do the rest call to the external endpoint(ant stockquote -Dtrpurl=http://localhost:8080/soap/StockQuote). In Both of above scenario what happen is ;when doing rest call; the SOAPEnvelope object has corrupted and because ; both Message Contexts refer to to the same SOAPEnvelope object ; in Log mediator when try to get string of SOAPEnvelope trows the the AxisFault 'java.util.NoSuchElementException ' due to the corrupted SOAPEnvelope. As a solution for above two scenarios ; we have to built the original SOAPEnvelope (only for above two scenario). The 'org.apache.http.ProtocolException: Transfer-encoding header already present ' Exception occurs due the side affect of the above AxisFault 'java.util.NoSuchElementException ' . This AxisFault did not catch in the Log mediator and therefore it goes up to the ServerWorker and ServerWorker log it an error and send it to the client as soap fault 'AxisEngine.sendFault(mc)'. At this point; synapse has already sent the http response with response Envelope received form the axis2server(OUT path) .Therefore ;sending soap fault from ServerWorker cause to resend the same Http response and occurs above 'org.apache.http.ProtocolException: Transfer-encoding header already present ' Exception. This situation can occur for any uncaught exception which cause to pop up it to the ServerWorker. you can see if you remove the log mediator from the configuration it will work properly .

Or is the intent to keep this sole issue open until there is a whirr stable release that depends on a final jclouds 1.5.x release?,1,tiny patch to bump to jclouds 1.5.0-beta.11 now that it's in Maven Central.,1.5.0-beta.10 in now Committed revision 1374393.,1,updated with spot price fix and tests,updated to fix paul's error,after applying this patch; please execute: svn rm --force ./core/src/main/java/org/apache/whirr/service/jclouds/TemplateBuilderStrategy.java ./core/src/test/java/org/apache/whirr/service/TemplateBuilderStrategyTest.java,replacement for previous patch,I'm recutting this patch. 10m,The following patch adds whirr.template parameter which can override all the other image; hardware; location; or login-user parameters Note; I also implemented it for the undocumented group-based parameters as templates.group.template,For use with the following test repo. Please report back to http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=1068 when done! <repository> <id>jclouds-staging</id> <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgjclouds-039</url> <releases> <enabled>true</enabled> </releases> <snapshots> <enabled>false</enabled> </snapshots> </repository>,bumped to jclouds 1.5.0-beta.9 Committed revision 1369253.,jclouds 1.5 isn't released; yet; so let's keep this open to track any updates based on betas; release candidates; etc,Marking this as fixed. Thanks guys!,tested with jclouds 1.5.0-beta.8 recently synced to maven central. committed WHIRR-593-mk5.patch as revision 1365445 Thanks; Andrei; Cosmin & Andrew for writing this. Thanks; Tom for checking!,This looks good to me. +1 pending beta-8.,New patch rolling out the noPassword() change and bumping the jclouds dependency to the as-yet-unreleased-but-coming-today 1.5.0-beta.8; which has the needed fix on the jclouds side.,can you try removing the .noPassword() and using jclouds 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT? I think the following commit should sort that: https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/commit/9d007a40b726bb3de492a947d83b98ddced872a5 If that works; I can cut 1.5.0-beta.8 tomorrow.,Latest patch ( WHIRR-593-mk4.patch) incorporates everything so far. I switched to .noPassword() instead of .password(null); since that seemed more correct. I'm more wary on rackspace next-gen than I was earlier - it seems to still have some issues with launching/tearing down instances in some contexts; but I'm not sure if that's just my account or what. Otherwise; PhaseExecutionBarrierTest passes on cloudservers-us and aws-ec2. Hadoop and ZK tests pass on both as well.,And fyi; I'm able to run against rackspace-cloudservers-us just as well as against anything else; so we've got openstack support. =),Ah; and I'd already tried adding password(null) to ScriptBasedClusterAction. Seems like something is keeping a non-null password value there for cases where there was at some point a password - e.g.; cloudservers/cloudstack.,Hmmmm - I tried adding '.password(null)' to the LoginCredentials calls without it; in ClusterController; and that seems to have fixed the PhaseExecutionBarrierTest issues on cloudservers-us. Double-checking now.,I will try again later today and report back.,Hmm - I'm not actually seeing any test failures in services/hadoop or services/zookeeper against jclouds 1.5. Which specific tests are failing?,fwiw; it looked to me like Whirr was for some reason trying to use password authentication. It's claiming the rsa/sha1 fingerprints in jclouds-ssh.log; but the actual stacktrace refers to authPassword.,We need to find the root cause for those 'exhausted available authentication methods' on cloudservers-* before committing.,So what more do we need to do to get this in? The only problem I've still been seeing is that weird 'exhausted available authentication methods' one. Also; I see that Cosmin's patch (which for some reason I hadn't already applied) deals with FirewallManager's #(region) name; but not FirewallManagerTest - my patch did them both; but I'll just grab Cosmin's patch and add FirewallManagerTest to it.,Found an additional issue with security group naming - 1.5 doesn't append '#region' to EC2 security group names; so FirewallManager needed to be updated. This patch would go on top of the existing one.,fyi; I'm able to run hadoop and zk itests on CloudStack 3.0.3 (with a few tweaks I needed to deal with our CS setup being a bit strange).,Here's my jclouds ssh log for running PhaseExecutionBarrierTest on Rackspace in case someone finds it helpful. I see that it's ssh-ing in as root for the boostrap phase (that works fine); but for the configure phase it's ssh-ing in as my user (and fails). As I said before; it seems odd because I'm able to manually ssh as my user.,Here's a quick summary with some of the stuff I've been trying in the hopes that it might be useful for people: PhaseExecutionBarrierTest passes on AWS but no VM ever shows up in the AWS web console. I tried this in different regions and the result is the same. Here's the test output. Running this on rackspace produces 'Exhausted available authentication methods'. Here's the test output. Was able to tell it to use my ssh key from ~/.ssh as opposed to the random one but still no luck. Looking in the debugger; it seems like it's using the correct key. Also; I was able to ssh to the rackspace machine after the test failed so this kind of indicates that the key it was using was indeed correct even though it's complaining. Not having a catch clause here seems a bit worrying but testing showed that no exception was being thrown anyway.,not sure. I'll run jclouds regression test on cloudservers-us first and see if all ok,On cloudservers-us it fails with 'Exhausted available authentication methods'. Any ideas on what's different from jclouds 1.4.0?,Hadoop itests work fine aws-ec2. Still testing on cloudservers-us.,Reviewing now. I will try the Hadoop itests.,Here's a new version of the patch that fixes the failing ZooKeeper integration tests. This worked for me when testing against AWS. It's changing the naming convention used for some environment variables and removes the region name from the security group name.,I've just tried the itests from core - they fail on cloudservers-us but work file on aws-ec2.,And with 1.5; it's hanging. Hopefully it'll time out and tell me why it's hanging at some point. =),I just verified ZK working on trunk with 1.4; trying now with 1.5...,p.s. I used the following with zookeeper on version 0.7 today. Otherwise; it didn't work (ex. crash/burn) --image-id=us-west-1/ami-33fda576 --location-id=us-west-1,fwiw; I'm getting a failure in the Cassandra itests; but I'm getting that with 1.4 or 1.5.,Builds fine but I get a failure when running the ZooKeeper itests. I am investigating.,Please help test this patch! Note that jclouds 1.5 gives the following new providers and apis; so probably worth your while to help cloudstack (version 3.03) greenqloud-compute (carbon neutral service) joyentcloud (smartos) openstack-nova (essex),1.4.0 is not a stable release compared to 1.5. I'll help make a patch; especially as I have a demo in a couple days at uberconf!!

That second parameter I think is supposed to be the client's id; but what is passed is clients.size(). I might be wrong here but I don't see where this vector of clients is cleared in between tests; so is it true that at some point the set size is fixed and all the seeds are the same ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4694,,,x,,,,,As Wing Yew said; the .xsb files are not compiled Java code; so we can't generate sources for them.,Note: While TypeSystemHolder.class is a java class file; the .xsb files are not. They are simply binary files. There is no 'source' for them.,OK; I ask a different way: is it worth it to request those sourcecodes generation. Or is it too complex or not possible?,Actually; no; there is no source code for those.,Would it be possible to get sourcecode for a) TypeSystemHolder b) .xsb 'classes'?,Johannes; The TypeSystemHolder class is still required at run-time. It contains information about the Schema<->Java relationship (name mappings etc) that is not available elsewhere. You need to make sure that you have the .jar containing this class and all the generated .xsb classes on the classpath at runtime (look for these classes in the directory that you specify as 'classgendir' in ant. This issue merely asked that this dependency be only a run-time one (rather than both compiletime and runtime) so that IDEs can show the generated classes without having to re-load their classpath every time the files get re-generated. And this seems to be fixed.,OK; generation and compilation of the generated sourcecode now seems to work.

Now refer to TypeSystemHolder via a reflection API instead of directly.,If anyone's intersted; I managed to make Eclipse happy without the TypeSystemHolder source by adding the output directory (where the TypeSystemHolder.class files get generated) to the project 'Libraries' in the Java Build Path for the project. I also made my maven build work by manually copying the TypeSystemHolder.class files up to the target directory in a java:compile pregoal: <preGoal name='java:compile'> <attainGoal name='generate-xmlbeans'/> <ant:copy todir='${maven.build.dest}'> <ant:fileset dir='${xmlbeans.output.dir}'> <include name='**/*.class'/> </ant:fileset> </ant:copy> </preGoal>,I just retested with 2.0 final version: definitely the sourcecode being generated is not compilable as it misses the TypeSystemHolder.java _SOURCECODE_. åÊ åÊNot with 2.0-beta1; nor with 2.0 final. åÊNot with '-scronly=true' nor without!! åÊ åÊThis is definitely no IDE problem (btw: I'm using IntelliJ; not Eclipse). åÊ åÊNote: the xmlbeans-generated .jar contains a TypeSystemHolder.class file. åÊ åÊThe annoying thing is: when creating the .jar with xmlbeans itself (only way working so far) I do not have full control about javac options used. åÊ åÊAnd IMHO this is no minor bug when creating not compilable sourcecode; please re-consider this.,I've just tried upgrading to 2.0; and I'm getting the same problem. I'm compiling with -srconly; and I get a TypeSystemHolder.class generated; but no TypeSystemHolder.java! This is not just an Eclipse issue - the TypeSystemHolder.java files seems to be simply not generated.,With the actual 2.0 release I get the same effect even without -srconly! No TypeSystemHolder.java is generated; which causes IDEs like Eclipse to complain. You can reproduce it simply by compiling one of the sample schemas: åÊcd xmlbeans-2.0.0/schemas åÊåÊ../bin/scomp -src src -d out easypo.xsd åÊåÊfind src -name '*TypeSystemHolder*.java' ... and nothing is found!,Johannes; I have no problems building that Schema file. I have become convinced that this is an Eclipse-only issue because it can't pick up dependencies from a different directory than the source. I am going to fix this by removing that compile-time dependency; but in order to do this I need some APIs that don't currently exist; so I was going to wait on it a bit.,XTCE 1.0 OMG specification (http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/apps/do_doc?dtc/03-09-02.pdf) 2.0.1-beta1 does not create valid sourcecode for,Without -srconly there is created a .jar but the sourcecode written to disk is cannot be the one having been compiled as the generated interfaces contain references to not existing classes like ...schema.system.s88336473178149A1091FEBD8E40E9E6C.TypeSystemHolder that do not exist - and therefore are not compilable (though the corresponding .class file is found within the generated .jar).

That would give you the 'current' state more accurately than a stale LOOKING notification and it seems like it could solve this particular problem. We could; but that wouldn't give an accurate state as well. A peer might be in the LOOKING state (next FLE round) while the lastMessage gets sent. There will be race conditions. In my opinion; a better way of doing this is to send the current state instead of lastMessage. In which case; I agree with Flavio that sending the final notifications won't be necessary. This will also reduce the number of notifications exchanged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can now obtain helpers that support extensible namespaces by calling SDOUtil.createHelperContext(true).,Sorry - previous was wrong version. Someone with admin rights could remove the older versions,Handles same issue with attributes?,Hi everyone. There are 4 places in the createFeature method where eClass.getEStructuralFeatures().add is called. First is when content kind is mixed and type is EFeatureMapEntry (whatever that means - but name was 'mixed'). Second is alsp content kind mixed and everything else - eg. xMLNSPrefixMap. Third is type instanceof EClass which is where I changed the add to set. Fourth is the attributes. I believe the issue Frank raised with the attributes is handled if there put: åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊint existingIndex = eClass.getEAllStructuralFeatures().indexOf(eClass.getEStructuralFeature(name)); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊif (existingIndex > -1) { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ eClass.getEStructuralFeatures().set(existingIndex; eAttribute); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ} else { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ eClass.getEStructuralFeatures().add(eAttribute); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ} I have tried to modify the test case for this and it seems to handle it. I'll attach the two new versions (still don't know what that Patch thing is). Are we covered now? And have you thought about how to implement these changes the right way? ps. I haven't looked at the simple type issue you mention Frank.,I feared that the hack wasn't good enough and generally I never expected that the changes was of a standard that could get into the SDO baseline. That fact that code is more or replicated directly from EMF is not pretty. Of course I am willing to follow this issue and keep testing etc. I fear that I won't be able to make any relevant changes without your help as I find the EMF part hard to get a thorough understanding of. First I'll try to update the qad test-case to see I can trigger the issue you mention.,Christian; I'm glad to see that you've been able to run your test case; but the hack in createFeature() is not the proper general solution. We can't change the behavior of createFeature() like this; or it will break other things. For example; in the case where there are real duplicates - e.g.; a complexType with an attribute and and element with the same name. This also doesn't handle the case of a global element of simpleType. So; we can't commit this kind of change in Tuscany - we need to come up with a proper way to do it without breaking other things. How soon are you looking to have this implemented and if the answer is soon; are you willing to keep helping with the implementation?,Mail archive: åÊåÊåÊåÊhttp://www.mail-archive.com/tuscany-user@ws.apache.org/msg00644.html,Sorry I don't know that Patch thing :( This version contains the latest changes where the createFeature has been pulled down from XSDECoreBuilder. Since I (at the moment) did not want to change code in EMF I had to pull down the entire createFeature method (since it was already overridden) from XSDECoreBuilder and changed at the spot you pointed out: åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// NON-TUSCANY åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊint existingIndex = eClass.getEAllStructuralFeatures().indexOf(eClass.getEStructuralFeature(name)); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊif (existingIndex > -1) { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ eClass.getEStructuralFeatures().set(existingIndex; eReference); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ} else { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ eClass.getEStructuralFeatures().add(eReference); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ} Now the test class succeds even using DocumentRoot!!! I have no idea if all scenarios are handled...,Reading a response from Frank Budinsky; I realized that the issues are probably solved with the 2 fixes. Adding or replacing individual properties in a single type is not necessary when you can redefine an entire type. SO changing TestTypeChangesAndExtensibleNamespaces.generate to just: XSDHelper.INSTANCE.define(new String(xsdFile.getBytes('UTF-8'))); DataObject documentDataObject = DataFactory.INSTANCE.create(namespace; rootElement+'Type'); handleRootDataObject(documentDataObject); Actually makes the program work! Frank's answer: Looking at your test program; I can see that what you're trying to do is more than I thought; so it's going to be harder. Let me explain. In the FIRST part; you define a Type named 'TestElementXType'. Then in SECOND; you add a second Type: 'TestElementYType'; which should work with the 'true' added to XSDHelper.define(); which allows it to proceed. In the THIRD part; you redefine Type 'TestElementXType'; which should work with the addToSortedList() change. That's my theory; anyway :-) What isn't working; since we haven't done anything to support it; is incremental addition/modification of the properties in a Type. Right now; all we have is the ability to add new types or completely replace a type with a new version (like you're doing for TestElementXType in part THREE). You can't add to or replace individual properties in a single type; which is what you're also trying to do with the global elements/properties in the 'DocumentRoot' Type. To test this theory; you could change the global element in the first schema to something like this: åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ<element name='RootElement' type='xsd:AnyType'/> and then delete the global elements in the second and third schemas. This way; you would define the 'DocumentRoot' Type in the first call to XSDHelper.define() and it would contain the property 'RootElement'. On the second and third calls to TypeHelper.define(); since you have no new global elements; it won't change/replace the 'DocumentRoot'; which is causing the problem. I think you should try to get this much working first; then we can think about how to specially handle the DocumentRoot. Note that if we just change things to allow you to also add new properties or change properties in a Type; then it wouldn't be doing the right thing to 'TestElementXType' in the THIRD part - you would have ended up with a 'TestElementXType' that has 4 properties (2 double and 2 integer) instead of a redefinition. Frank.,Here is the rather ugly version with the methods copied down from XSDECoreBuilder...,Just inserted 'true' to force namespace to be extended. All changes marked by NON-TUSCANY comment,This program demonstrates the issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

38950,x,,,,,,,I've re-worked my code and the problem has now 'gone away'. The original code; where the problem was found; was ported from a solution that worked fine using ADF controls. The same code resulted in this problem. I moved some controls on the page around and altered some of the attributes and the tree table now collapses and expands as expected. Quite why the re-work has now eliminated the problem I do not know but as I need to progress with other things I've decided to close this issue rather than waste anymore of anybody's time. Thanks for all your help anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

27430,,x,,,,,,Looks solid. I'm okay with resolving this one.,OK I've committed this. One difference from the patch was I retained the 'Integer' options for different credit card types and the CreditCardValidator(int) constructor. Which should make migrating from the existing CreditCardValidator to the new 'routines' package version one easier.,Reassigning to Niall since he's graciously volunteered to finish it,I'm not sure whats happening with JSR 303 (I requested membership of the EG; but heard nothing after I signed up to the JCP) - except that the JSR was accepted nothing else seems to have happened. Anyway my impression was JSR 303 was more than just annotations and involved defining a framework. My aim with the 'routines' package was to clearly separate out 'validation routines' from the framework aspect of validator with the routines usable on their own outside of any framework stuff. If JSR 303 happens and defines; for example; a credit card annotation then there will need to be some 'glue' which recognises when a bean property has been annotated as a credit card and invokes our routines. I don't believe what were doing here would need to change - what would need to change is implementing the 'glue' (i.e. framework) which hooks the annotation to our routine. If/when JSR 303 happens this may turn out to be rubbish and as you say we may end up redoing this; but until JSR 303 becomes concrete its all just guesswork. Anyway; I've started on tests - need to add a bit more / finish off - but I think theres enough here to commit and I'll get back to it when I find some more cycles.,It's simple; which I'm a big fan of. The only concern I have is whether anything important is lost by treating credit cards only as validators ‰ÛÒ will we ever need to put them in collections; associate them with names; sort them; etc. ‰ÛÒ all the crap you want to use a full-fledged object for. I can't say something like that will definitely be required; but I can't rule it out either. I'm also wondering how easy it'll be to put JSR 303 annotations on top of this; but if it's going to be redone again for Validator 2; then no problem. My gut is saying that this is good enough and covers what people need today; and that going too overboard with it is overengineering. This works; is easy to understand; and simple to use; so I think going with it makes sense. Can you throw together tests for it?,P.S. Haven't tested the regular expressions here so it may have some glitches - I'll write tests if its agreed,As you mention I was thinking that the new routines version could use the new 'generic' code validator for individual cards and perhaps ditch the CreditCardType interface altogether. New cards types can simply be implemented by creating a new CodeValidator instance with an appropriate regular expression rather than having to define a new CreditCardType implementation. The main (IMO) advantage though is that if someone wanted to allow separators (spaces or dashes) they can define a regular expression with the separators as a 'non-capturing group' which means they get 'stripped' out before the check digit validation is done - and the valdiator can return a uniform card number without separators. Attaching an option for consideration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79309,,,,,,,,Closing old resolved issues,This task is going to take several hours (at least) to complete; especially as lots of new dependencies have been added to rave recently. Furthermore; the shindig dependencies turned up to not having their own appropriate license and notice files in place; which thus needs to be checked out first (by ourselves) too. For the next release (0.8-incubating) all this needs to be sorted out; before we can start creating a new release candidate... And therefore I'm upgrading this issue status to BLOCKER!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If there is a need for a more generic stanza logger; these users could use the plain interface. The adapter I made is intended for filtering; so that only textual chat messages between users are let through; which I think is the most interesting detail to be logged.

65661,,,,,,,,Fixed in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1210845,The ServiceMix 4 code implements this part of the JBI specification: /**  * Get the JBI context for this component. The following methods are valid to use on the context:  * <ul>  * <li>{@link ComponentContext#getMBeanNames()}</li>  * <li>{@link ComponentContext#getMBeanServer()}</li>  * <li>{@link ComponentContext#getNamingContext()}</li>  * <li>{@link ComponentContext#getTransactionManager()}</li>  * </ul>  * All other methods on the returned context must throw a <code>IllegalStateException</code> exception if invoked.  *   * @return the JBI context for this component; which must be non-null.  */ public ComponentContext getContext();  However; since ServiceMix 3 does implement the getLogger() method (in fact; it uses a full-blown ComponentContext implementation); so I wonder if we could ignore the specification here for ServiceMix 4 as well. What do people think? The obvious workaround would be to use any kind of logger (slf4j; commons-logging;...) in your own code ‰ÛÒ in ServiceMix 4; all of those are provided by pax-logging anyway so whichever you choose will be nicely integrated with the rest of the logging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

23492,,,,,,,,behvaiors:ajax calls is not always 1:1. some behaviors are purely clientside. also; this comes up often so we should offer the devs a choice to do this even if it can have unwanted sideeffects.,Here is a behavior based on JQuery.bind() that allows that. I created it to show how to use JQuery's mouseenter/mouseleave events but it can be used for this case too. I believe that assigning several behaviors on the same event is bad practice because this will make several Ajax calls to the server side. Better do one call and then at the server side delegate to all interested parties.,I just ran into this problem; and do not understand the last comment. Is this issue solved? Would it be possible with some hints for how developer should attach multiple behaviours to the same event?,I think we did allow users to delegate AJAX calls to their behavior as they want with the new event dispatcher API.,I've been trying to implement something like IMergeableBehavior; but because of so many specific properties each behavior can provide; I think it won't be a good idea. Maybe other things must be considered to solve this: 1) Defining an IEventBehavior - which would serve for Javascript events *only*; like onChange; etc... interface IEventBehavior extends IBehavior; IHeaderContributor { åÊåÊåÊåÊpublic String getEvent(); } 2) Defining a class called AggregatedEventBehavior - which would... aggregate IEventBehaviors of the same event type class AggregatedEventBehavior { åÊåÊåÊåÊpublic AggregatedEventBehavior(IEventBehavior... events) { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ... // check for event type consistency åÊåÊåÊåÊ} åÊåÊåÊåÊ.. // other methos like render; onComponentTag; etc; like in IBehavior } 3) Only one ajax call to this aggregated behavior (avoiding multiple Ajax calls) 4) If developer choses to add more than one event of the same type to a component; the framework should throw an exception. If the intention is to actually attach more than one behavior to the same event; the developer will have to use an IAggregatedEventBehavior 5) The need of a new method: Component.add(AggregatedEventBehavior) 6) Somehow; avoid the use of AttributeModifiers that refers to Javascript events Cheers; Bruno,moving to 1.4.0 This won't make it for 1.3,Assigned version (beta 4),I don't think this is going to make 1.3.0. Unscheduling for the time being.,The situation would already be improved a lot if the javadoc would make it clear that it is not possible to add multiple behaviors to the same event. Yet another option is to provide an aggregation behavior. Something that would allow you to merge 2 behaviors into 1. I am not sure how this could work. I am not familiar with Wicket.Event (a 1.3 feature?).,I don't really like this. We could use Wicket.Event for attaching events on to component instead of the attributes; but this would result in multiple ajax calls. I doubt that this is desirable.,i dont like what you propose; but i wont -1 it either; so go ahead.,i would say just call all ajax events that are on the same event. Why not that can be explained perfectly. Ajax works but if you have pure client side scripts it could fail (it could! because we still have already the ability to merge the behaviors!; so that you can prepend or append!),there is really no good way to do this that will work across the board. if we do it for ajax then people will want it for other things as well one compromise i can think of is to do this: iterate over behaviors that implement the invoked listener interface and call equals on them - if they are equal then invoke the listener on them as well is this a good compromise?,This has been discussed on the user list as well if I'm correctly. I thought the consensus was not to do anything about it; though error reporting could be improved?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since we do not do a hostdb lookup; the last two options: 2 - if the server has returned http1.1 before 3 - if the client request is 1.1 & the server has returned 1.1 before are problematic as we will never know if the server has previously returned a 1.1 response. All the patch does is set the 'previously seen server version' to be equal to the client request version ‰ÛÒ so if we are running with config option 2/3 set we will always send a request version that equals the client request version (which seems the best thing we can do in this transparent use case).
