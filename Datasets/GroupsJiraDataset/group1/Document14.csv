You can get the latest xwork.jar (which fixes the problem) from http://ivyrep.opensymphony.com,One can also reproduce the bug by using something similar to <ww:label label='foo' name='foo' value='% {2.5} '/> As a workaround; call the toString() method on the object; like this : <ww:label label='foo' name='foo' value='% {object.myLong.(toString())} '/>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

81302,,,,,,,,Changes merged to the 0.16 branch; updating the fix-for version accordingly.,Reviewed by Alex. Approved for 0.16.,Reviewed with no comments,Thats right; if the priority differs then the decision can/must be made solely based on that since it means the entries are within entirely different QueueEntryLists; however if both are of the same priority then the entry IDs must be used to determine the relative position within a particular QueueEntryList.,Awesome...thanks a lot Robbie for the update...Now I understand the cause quite well. i looked at your CL..and it makes sense..I see that now you're actually comparing against the priority value itself; unlike earlier where the id's of the last seen/released messages were compared. Thanks a ton...I will try to play around with the updated code in trunk; and let you know if I find any issues (I guess I won't),Hi Alex; can you click the review button please,Hi praveen; The second consumer being present meant it would never work as-was; but it did indeed have nothing to do with why it failed to work originally; which actually seems to be identical in both test cases above in the end. The out-of-order queues (Priority; Sorted) make specific attempt during enqueues to ensure that when a message is added that would violate traditional FIFO behaviour that the consumer subscriptions are updated to reflect that they need to 'go back' and progress delivery from this 'earlier' point. This is ultimately done by leveraging the same underlying mechanism used to handle messages being acquired by consumers and then released back onto the queue again without actually being consumed (hence the 'released' field name references scattered throughout the process). There was a fairly clear defect in the way checking the need for such updates was performed with the PriorityQueues meaning it could fail to take the proper course of action and lead to the situation you observed; where a subscription had effectively already passed one or more higher priority messages and wouldnt be able to 'go back' for them meaning they would just sit on the queue. The update I made seems like it should fix the problem; and did allow both your examples to run reliably (after the modifications as mentioned above). In addition to the unit test(s) added with the update earlier; I have now also added a system test based on the process in your example which would sporadically fail to receive all the messages without the fix in place; and then reliably receives them all with it present. This is all on trunk now so you can try it out for yourself if you like. I forced the build of the nightly release job for the Java artefacts (https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/Qpid/job/Qpid-Java-Artefact-Release) to run early; so the broker artefacts at this URL should now contain the fix: https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/Qpid/job/Qpid-Java-Artefact-Release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/trunk/qpid/java/broker/release/ Robbie,Hi Robbie; Thanks for the update. In the second case; I meant to close to consumer in the failing test that I sent you. I've updated the test and added it again. Even when I close the initial consumer the issue exists. Would that also be fixed by your change? Thanks a lot for taking this up immediately. It'd be great if we can get this in 0.16. Thanks; Praveen,I have taken a look at this today and noticed an issue in the PriorityQueue; which looks to have been possibly highlighted by a change made since 0.14 to resolve a not entirely dissimilar issue with the SortedQueue implementation which was added (see QPID-3704). I have committed a candidate fix to trunk; I'll request its inclusion in 0.16 once I do/add some further testing; although it is Justins call whether it makes the release. The example for your second case wasn't closing its initial consumer; so this will cause it to hold a prefetched message. Both examples were leaving messages on the broker when they were 'complete'. Modifying them to resolve those issues; I was able to repeatedly run them both successfully with the above mentioned change in place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29394,,,X,,,,,Closing this issue - if more needs to be done; maybe it would be better to open an new issue - this one has gotten rather large,Enabled default messaging between colocated components using java queues. Removed conditional 'UseVmTransport'. Enabled support for setting number of listener threads on both input and output queues for colocated components. Modified reply JMS connection to broker to always send messages asynchronously. Optimized JmsOutputChannel.java to set the Host IP once in the constructor; instead of computing it for every outgoing message. Profiler indicates that computing the Host IP is quite costly. Modified global boolean flags to be volatile to make sure that the changes made are immediately visible to other threads.,Need dd2spring change to add a new property to each collocated endpoint bean which specifies a number of concurrent listener threads that will process requests. With AMQ the concurrentConsumers property was set on the MessageListener bean which is no longer present for collocated delegate. Collocated uima as services use a java queue and ThreadPoolExecutor. The latter may be configured to process messages concurrently in multiple threads. An example Endpoint bean with the new property would like this: <!-- ==================================== --> <!-- InnerTestMultiplier --> <!-- ** Delegate Endpoint ** --> <!-- ==================================== --> <bean id='endpt_InnerTestMultiplier_1.1' class='org.apache.uima.aae.controller.Endpoint_impl'> <!-- Broker URI --> <property name='serverURI' value='vm://localhost'/> <!-- Delegate key name or remote queue name --> <property name='endpoint' value='inQ_InnerTestMultiplier_1.1'/> <!-- Timeouts --> <property name='metadataRequestTimeout' value='0'/> <property name='processRequestTimeout' value='0'/> <property name='collectionProcessCompleteTimeout' value='0'/> <property name='concurrentConsumers' value='3'/> </bean> The value for the above bean's concurrentConsumers should be the same value the was previously set on the Message Listener bean of the collocated service.,Another problem with dd2spring. A message handler chain for an aggregate does not contain handler for processing requests coming from a remote delegate Cas Multiplier. When a CM receives an input CAS; it generates new CASes from it. These new CASes are sent to the client (aggregate) in a Request message. An InputChannel for handling messages from a remote Cas Multiplier must include the following handlers: 1) ProcessResponse Handler - processing Process reply msgs from the remote ( Needed for both Remote CM and Non-CM). This handler handles Input CASes returned from the delegate 2) ProcessRequest Handler - processing requests msgs from the remote (Only for Remote Cas Multipliers). This handler handles New CASes sent by the remote delegate CM. 3) GetMetaResponse Handler - processing GetMete reply msgs from the remote ( Needed for both Remote CM and Non-CM) Currently only 1 and 3 are added by dd2spring. Need #2 as well.,Found another problem with dd2spring. Inner aggregate bean with remote delegate is missing an OutputChannel Bean. This bean is required to send messages to a remote delegate. <!- ======================================-> <!-- Async Aggregate: MeetingDetector_1.2 --> <!- ======================================-> <bean id='asAggr_ctlr_MeetingDetector_1.2' class='org.apache.uima.aae.controller.AggregateAnalysisEngineController_impl' init-method='initialize'> <constructor-arg index='0' ref='asAggr_ctlr_TopLevelTaeQueue_1'/> <constructor-arg index='1' value='MeetingDetector'/> <constructor-arg index='2' value='file:/C:/dev/workspace/apache-uima/uimaj-as-activemq/src/test/resources/descriptors/analysis_engine/../tutorial/ex4/MeetingDetectorAndNoOpTAE.xml'/> <constructor-arg index='3' ref='casManager'/> <constructor-arg index='4' ref='inProcessCache'/> <constructor-arg index='5' ref='delegate_map_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='serviceEndpointName' value='inQ_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='controllerBeanName' value='asAggr_ctlr_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='errorHandlerChain' ref='err_hdlr_chn_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='flowControllerDescriptor' value='*importByName:org.apache.uima.flow.FixedFlowController'/> </bean>,I put this change in (to set lazy-init) and Jerry tried it and it didn't help. I'm taking it out; as it seems this isn't the issue (Jerry agrees). Jerry found another problem - Generated bean below refers to a non-existent bean aggregate_return_metaMsgHandler_TopLevelTaeQueue_1 which is a bean reference for the messageHandler property. The bean for JmsInputChannel is required in this case. This input channel is for processing replies from a remote primitve delegate. This input channel needs the message handler chain. <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <!-- JMS msg listener for return queue for: --> <!-- rmtRtrnQ_TopLevelTaeQueue_1_NoOp --> <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <bean id='asAggr_return_q_listenerID_TopLevelTaeQueue_1_NoOp' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.JmsInputChannel'> <property name='messageHandler' ref='aggregate_return_metaMsgHandler_TopLevelTaeQueue_1'/> <property name='endpointName' value=''/> <property name='controller' ref='asAggr_ctlr_TopLevelTaeQueue_1'/> </bean> Working on fixing this...,Marshall; the latest fix resolved the problem; but I have another one. Constructors for collocated Controllers are not being called by Spring during Spring container deployment. It took me awhile to realize that the most likely cause is the fact that Spring uses lazy initialization for beans. Changes made in dd2spring removed depenendencies which triggered Spring to initialize collocated controllers. The way to fix this is to add a new bean property for collocated controller beans ( both Primitive and Aggregate) called lazy-init='false'. An example: <bean id='primitive_ctlr_SPCM_1.2.1' class='org.apache.uima.aae.controller.PrimitiveAnalysisEngineController_impl' init-method='initialize' lazy-init='false'> ... Again this should be done only for collocated Controllers. If I am right this will force instantiation of the beans.,Ok - found a logic problem and fixed this. Please test .,The latest dd2spring is not generating two required beans for remote delegates in the aggregate spring xml. Beans below are *not* in the generated spring xml: <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <!-- JMS msg listener for return queue for: --> <!-- rmtRtrnQ_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp --> <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <bean id='asAggr_return_q_listenerID_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.JmsInputChannel'> <property name='messageHandler' ref='aggregate_return_metaMsgHandler_InnerAggregateQueue_1'/> <property name='endpointName' value=''/> <property name='controller' ref='asAggr_ctlr_InnerAggregateQueue_1'/> </bean> <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <!-- JMS msg listener container for return queue for: --> <!-- rmtRtrnQ_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp --> <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <bean id='asAggr_return_msgLsnrCntnr_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.UimaDefaultMessageListenerContainer'> <!-- Define number of JMS Consumers --> <property name='concurrentConsumers' value='1'/> <!-- return Queue --> <property name='destinationResolver' ref='destinationResolver_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp'/> <property name='destinationName' value=''/> <property name='targetEndpoint' ref='endpt_RemoteNoOp_1.2'/> <!-- POJO to delegate JMS Messages to --> <property name='messageListener' ref='asAggr_return_q_listenerID_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp'/> <property name='connectionFactory' ref='qBroker_tcp_c__ss_localhost_c_8118'/> </bean>,Jerry tested the above fix; and found a couple of issues: dd2spring doesnt generate the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean in the Primitive Top Level sping xml; which should look like: <!-- ThreadPool Task Executor --> <bean id='pooling_NoOpAnnotatorQueue2_1' class='org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor'> <property name='corePoolSize' value='1'/> <property name='maxPoolSize' value='1'/> <property name='queueCapacity' value='1'/> </bean> This bean is required by the top level message listener. <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <!-- JMS msg listener container for input queue for: --> <!-- top_level_input_queue_service_1 --> <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <bean id='primitive_input_msgLsnrCntnr_NoOpAnnotatorQueue_1' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.UimaDefaultMessageListenerContainer'> <!-- Connect to pooling task executor for primitive --> <property name='taskExecutor' ref='pooling_NoOpAnnotatorQueue2_1'/> <!-- Define number of JMS Consumers --> <property name='concurrentConsumers' value='1'/> <!-- input Queue --> <property name='destination' ref='top_level_input_queue_service_1'/> <!-- POJO to delegate JMS Messages to --> <property name='messageListener' ref='primitive_input_q_listenerID_NoOpAnnotatorQueue_1'/> <property name='connectionFactory' ref='qBroker_tcp_c__ss_localhost_c_8118'/> <property name='messageSelector' value='Command=2000 OR Command=2002'/> </bean> If there is a listener there should also be a corresponding ThreadPoolTaskExecutor for it.,1) I found that dd2spring was generating a message handler chain for reply queues that was including the handlers for the out-going getMeta and process calls - I removed these. 2) after some discussion with Jerry; I changed the logic in dd2spring for message handler chains; input channels; and listeners as follows: Top level has 'input' versions of these; co-located inner components do not If any delegates are remote; then those remotes have individual instances of input channels and listeners for 'return/replies'; but share the message handler chain for returning messages. If no delegate is remote; then no 'return' input channles; listeners; or message handler chains are made. Doing #11 above - change references to this output channel to null (actually; remove the <property ...> element referring to it,Sorry for the confusion; I meant to say ThreadPoolExecutor instead of TaskExecutor. Corrected initial comment.,In the first comment; change 'java's TaskExecutor framework' to 'Spring's TaskExecutor framework' - I believe it's an interface in Spring; and there is no class/interface called this in Java 5 or 6.,Since we are removing internal broker for messaging; dd2spring needs to be modified to remove unnecessary beans.

All files attached here have been generated after an update was done,Jerry; am having problems applying the patch files. Many patches appear to be against the wrong versions. Thanks; Eddie,Description of the patches in the previous comment. Forgot to grant license to ASF,Provided an alternate mechanism for messaging between colocated Uima As services. Instead of using jms based queues the internal messaging is done via java queues. The new messaging implementation uses java's ThreadPoolExecutor framework which provides necessary synchronization and threading. Each Uima As service uses a new UimaDispatcher component to send outbound messages and a UimaListener component for receiving incoming messages. Each incoming message is processed in a separate thread provided by the ThreadPoolExecutor. The number of threads used by the ThreadPoolExecutor depends on the value of the 'inputQueueScaleout' attribute for incoming messages and the 'internalReplyQueueScaleout' attribute for outgoing messages. Both of these attributes are configured in the deployment descriptor. ******************************************************************************************************************************* NOTE: The default messaging mechanism is still JMS using internal Broker. To enable java queue's for internal messaging use -DUseVmTransport=true system property. ******************************************************************************************************************************* Fixed Uima As controller code to enable support for colocated Aggregate Cas Multiplier.

10314,,,,,,X,,First I want to verify that Gretchen's fix >Additional Comments From Gretchen Chiaramonte 2003-09-22 20:04 ------- for this bug works for me as well using Xalan 2.6.0. Second; regarding: >Additional Comments From Igor Hersht 2003-08-12 22:59 ------- ... >If I recall correctly we had such discussion before. >We consider that as a wrong usage. >The correct method would be to create transformer and >to do multiple transformations like >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); To help clarify what Gretchen has already implied; I believe that this doesn't complete the story. Xalan currently fails unneccessarily if 'xmlSource' is an XMLFilter chain headed by an XML source The XMLFilter chain should be reusable with only the source is refreshed. But at the end of the TransformerImpl.transformNode() call; the DTMManager is erased by the call to XPathContext.reset() as cited by Gretchen. This manager is what binds the XMLFilter to e.g. its stylesheet. Therefore; until this bug is repaired; the filter chain cannot be reused. That's a shame because I suspect that setting up the filter chain (eg reading the stylesheet from disk) is more work than constructing the transformer. In case it isn't obvious; a workaround re-creates the XMLFilter chain each time is it transformed. I did not find this bug report at first. Sorting out why I was getting a NullPointerException was a lot of work; partly because Xalan is built in to the JDK runtime but the 'endorsed' jar files are stored in common/endorsed under tomcat rather than JDK's endorsed (surprise ;-). In addition; Xalan has another bug in DTMManagerDefault.getDTM() (incorrectly returns the null this thread discusses) and one in TransformerImpl.run() (inappropriate throw calls). I will enter these as new bugs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

22691,,,,x,X,,,By the way; the javadoc for the minimum and maximum validators are still not updated (and incorrect). They need to be precise as to whether or not the endpoints are included. For example: * Gets a Double maximum validator for checking if an number is smaller than the given maximum Should read 'is at most' or 'smaller than or equal to'. Same with the other validators (including the range validators).,It's a beautiful fix; it took me a while to understand it. :-) Double.MIN_VALUE is *REALLY* counterintuitive (especially considering Integer.MIN_VALUE). bsh % -1.0 < Double.MIN_VALUE; <true> bsh % -1 < Integer.MIN_VALUE; <false> I still think it's a good idea to deprecate POSITIVE and NEGATIVE as Igor suggested and at least cleary mention the API change; because there will probably be people depending on the old behavior.,this works to /** * a validator for ensuring for a positive number value */ public static final NumberValidator POSITIVE = minimum(Double.MIN_VALUE); /** * a validator for ensuring a negative number value */ public static final NumberValidator NEGATIVE = maximum(-Double.MIN_VALUE); But maybe seb can shoot a hole in this. But my added unit test say it works! I added numerous unit test on the way for the NumberValidator classes. So we have even a better coverage!,imho parameters should always be INCLUSIVE. so range (3;5) should accept 3;4;5. minumum(0) should accept 0;1;2;... why do we even have POSITIVE and NEGATIVE? obviously it is rather ambiguous. lets deprecate those. i mean does it really save that much having them as global instances? they still get serialized the same...,bulk set issues to next version. I only did a quick check (and filtered some out for 1.3.1); but we can always bump em again.,The minimum validator is correct. If the value is STRICTLY LESS than the minimum; you should fail; and only then. It seems to me the javadoc is wrong there. It should read something like 'check if an integer value is at least the given minimum value'. As far as POSITIVE being a minimum(0) validator; that seems incorrect to me. And I'd prefer it if the Wicket world didn't have it's own version of mathematics. ;-) The 'inclusive' flag seems useful to me; but then the naming is a bit unintuitive in my opinion.,'hmm it all starts with the minimum(0) method;we do say there: /** * Gets a Integer minimum validator to check if a integer value is greater * then the given minimum value. * */ public static NumberValidator minimum(long minimum) { return new MinimumValidator(minimum); } but the check isn't if (value <= minimum) fail but if (value < minimum) fail now i am curious what people expect to happen.. is it including or not?? same goes for the maximum validator.. But do we change the maximum/minimum validators ? Or what i also can do is add a param to the constructors of those with an including flag.. By default it stays what it is now except for the Positive and Negative onces. Or we can always just say in a wicket world the 0 is negative and positive!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

23248,,,,,,,,Fixed in trunk (r555005).,Ah; I see. I was evidently being a bit dense before; sorry. Will get around to this later today on trunk and 1.2.x branches.,Palette is constructed using a ChoiceRenderer as the 4th argument. There are 3 ways to construct a ChoiceRenderer; two of those do not require specifying an id expression because the item's index can be used instead. This works fine in most cases but not for the Palette. When creating a Palette object make sure you use a ChoiceRenderer that has been constructed with the 2-argument constructor; specifying both display and id expression.,Sorry; I don't quite follow you. How is this unclear? You need to implement an IChoiceRenderer. This clearly has two method signatures you need to implement; which are both properly javadoc'ed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THRIFT-1883 did not apply so I thought to do this first...,On what? This is worthless without THRIFT-1883. GObject Introspection requires you to annotate the code (see https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Annotations) so it knows things like when to transfer ownership; parameter direction; generic container types; etc.; and in order to do that you have to use GTK-Doc style comments. This could be used without THRIFT-1882; but if that's going to happen it makes much more sense to do it first. That said; I'm actually having second thoughts about this (and THRIFT-1885). I'm in the middle of writing a new implementation (see http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/thrift-dev/201303.mbox/browser for some of the reasons why); and I'd rather use the Thrift namespace for that instead of c_glib. I could change the namespace on this patch to something else (ThriftGLib; maybe); but if something better is coming I don't see much gain in exposing c_glib to other languages.,committed this: 0001-Move-typedefs-before-public-structs-to-work-around-g.patch please rebase second patch.,0005-THRIFT-1879-Add-GObject-Introspection-support.patch This actually causes a GObject Introspection Repository (and a typelib) to be generated and installed; resolving this issue.

16927,,,,,,,,I'll update the javadoc accordingly.,No; you're right that it isn't WSS4J's fault how other programs use it. However; I find the X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER to be a non-standard extension made by WSS4J and I suggest it to be documented as such to lessen the probability that users of WSS4J uses it without knowing the implications. Regards åÊåÊMattias,It's not WSS4J's fault if other programs are calling the wrong API's...as Werner said; it must be using X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER instead of SKI_KEY_IDENTIFIER. The X.509 1.0 profile doesn't mandate using SKI as a KeyIdentifier; so it's perfectly acceptable to support the X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER behaviour.,The tool in question is SoapUI (www.soapui.org); and there aren't any way to set configure which key identifier type should be used. We should report this to them as well; but we'd still have a problem since our client uses yet another tool (from IBM I think) that seems to exhibit the same behavior and we also have other reasons to suspect it uses WSS4J internally. Anyway; in the 1.0 X.509 profile found at http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-x509-token-profile-1.0.pdf ; the use of an X.509 certificate is described as a ValueType for a BinarySecurityToken (Table 2) but not for a KeyIdentifier (Table 3); as far as I can see. Might I be looking in the wrong document? Regards; Mattias SjÌ¦lÌ©n,Just checked this: this is the WSS4J handler key identifier code 'X509KeyIdentifier'; the tool should use 'SKIKeyIdentifier' instead. Or; if the tool uses it programatically: WSConstants.SKI_KEY_IDENTIFIER instead of WSConstants.X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER The X509KeyIdentifier was defined in X509 profile of WS Security V1.0 (AFAIK not in 1.1 anymore) but this is backward compatibilty with 1.0 . Regards; Werner,WSS4J support several key identifier types; for example SKI (Subject Key Identifier); X509v3; thumbprint and others. It is the task of the software that uses WSS4J library to select the key identifier type; thus the 'Java based tool om Windows' sould set the correct parameters. Where do you (or the 'tool') specify which key identifier type (profile) to use? Regards; Werner 401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0#Base64Binary' > ValueType='http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401,Hi Mattias; I can't reproduce this issue.

19722,,X,,,,,,Just an idea: how about treating a jar as versioned resource? For example in my case that would work beautifully: my star rating component was in its own jar file; so everything would have the same version somewhere above; and all the relative URLs would resolve just fine. Since jar is pretty much invisible at runtime maybe we can have some version marker inside package; and then version in the URL can be at the level; so all other relative URLs inside package would work fine below that level. That might make sense for other cases: for example a skin for application where bunch of images and css and scripts can be packaged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

19423,,,,,,,,Attached QuickStart. Access URL is https://localhost:8443/test/ajaxtest - click on the buttons several times - refresh page: the counters should now reflect the clicks - click on the buttons more times - refresh page: the counters do not reflect click after first refresh,a valid usecase: whats happening is this user hits the page /foo goes to /foo?1 does a bunch of ajax stuff; staying on /foo?1 clicks refresh; so hits /foo?1 listview refreshes; changing hierarchy; creating page version 2 the ajax behavior's url is rendered as /foo?2:... the page is rendered; but not redirected to /foo?2 so what we have now is a browser pointing to /foo?1 and ajax (and non-ajax) urls pointing to /foo?2 further clicks work only because the component they repaint has the same markup id on page 1 and page 2. however; all model changes are stored in page 2. this is why when the browser is refreshed the counter reverts to a previous value - because it is page 1 that is rerendered. there are two ways to fix this: 1) redirect to correct version. so when the browser is refreshed for the first time on /foo?1 the browser would redirect to /foo?2 and it would keep doing that for every refresh. not ideal. 2) freeze the page version when we are accessing a url that we know will not mutate the state of the page - meaning urls that just render the page and do not invoke any listeners. the only state we will lose is noise from component replacement in listviews and user's onbeforerender() overrides which i think is acceptable since they do not represent true state mutation that comes from intentional callbacks.,No; I think the issue is that non-AJAX reloads that render ListViews end up calling MarkupContainer#add; incrementing the page ID but not updating the URL. The relevant change is in Page#dirty() which only scheduled a page to be flushed in 1.4; and now assigns it a new page ID.,i think the root cause here is the difference in caching; not how page version or ajax is handled. in 1.5.x the back button causes a request back to the server which causes the page to be rerendered and the version incremented. in 1.4.x the back button would not cause a request to the server; instead the cached version of the page would be shown. im not sure why this was changed in 1.5.x; may be worth opening a discussion on dev@.,go to http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples/ajax/links this is wicket 1.5.x (1.5.4 currently) click the ajax link to increment the counter a few times. reload the page. counter retains its value; ajax changes are not lost. click the back link; you will be taken wherever you were before. since ajax links did not cause a url change and no browser history change you are not taken to a page with counter's previous value. this is exactly how 1.4 behaves. the only difference between the two is that 1.5.x always redirects to a non-bookmarkable url so a refresh never loses ajax changes like it did in 1.4.x which did not redirect to a non-bookmarkable url so a refresh would recreate the page from scratch.,I agree there isn't a good solution without AJAX history; but I respectfully disagree that 1.4 worked the same. In 1.4 reloading the page returned the most recent version of a page (the one with the most AJAX updates); in 1.5 those AJAX changes can be lost on reload/back.,this is no different then how 1.4.x worked. the back button takes you back to the state of the page before ajax changes. in order for it to take you back to the 'last' click we would need ajax history support; which we do not yet have.,I think this ticket should be closed as 'Not a problem' because ListView is designed to work this way - in each call of its onBeforeRender() it recreates its items which makes the page dirty; and therefore increases the page id. Thomas can open a new ticket with a quickstart.,@Thomas: can you attach a quickstart with your case too ?,And my disclaimer: I didn't design this; I'm just interpreting the code. If I'm wrong; I hope somebody corrects me. :),There are two concepts here: 'touched' pages and 'dirty' pages. Simply retrieving a page from the page manager 'touches' it; scheduling it for serialization into the page store at the end of the request. The question is whether it updates the original page store entry; or goes into a new entry. The page gets a new page map entry if and only if it is marked 'dirty' which is triggered by component hierarchy change; component model change; or explicitly with Page#dirty(). However; WebPage#dirty() has a special case which prevents AJAX requests from *ever* marking a page dirty. So after the request that originally created your wizard's page; there must be another non-AJAX request which dirties the page and advances its identifier past the one in the browser address bar.,And: yes; the ajax URLs target an incremented version of the page; while the URL still shows the 'old' one.,@Dan: what exactly do you mean by that? It seems to me that the page *should* be dirtied upon ajax operations (+ model changes)?! Because on page reload the 'old' state is restored (after page has been rendered); so everything that happend after this (via AJAX) is not serialized; or do I get this wrong?,Thomas; it sounds likely. Look at the AJAX URLs to see if they're targeting a different page version than in the URL. Note that AJAX requests themselves don't advance the page identifier (see WebPage#dirty(boolean)); but for example normal reloads containing ListViews will. So maybe you can workaround the issue in your wizard by identifying and suppressing the non-AJAX; page-dirtying operation.,I'm not quite sure if this is related to the problem; but I guess so: we have a page containing an AJAX wizard. Users can go forward and backward and fill several form components which are correctly written into the model when the wizard step is changed (via AJAX). But: if you reload the page; all input data is gone (from all wizard pages); as the URL still shows ?0 ...,My concern is after the page ID is advanced due to a reload or back button any model updates done on that version can never be retrieved. With 1.4 the view did not reflect the most recent version of the page; but since the page ID never advanced the model was intact. As Dan mentions with 1.5 we can easily get into situations where ajax requests target different page version; and with that a different copies of page models.,That's an old ticket! :) 1.5's liberal advancement of the page identifier changes Wicket's limited AJAX versioning support significantly; in my opinion detrimentally: 1. In 1.4 reloading a page (with back or reload buttons) results in the most recent version associated with that URL; in 1.5 it results in the oldest version. 2. With a 1.5 AJAXy page; it seems quite easy to get into a state where different AJAX behaviors target different versions of the same page. That sounds confusing to debug. ListView's effect on the page version makes the gotcha more unexpected; but I agree it's working as designed. Maybe Wicket's AJAX versioning gotchas just get an extra underscore for now; pending full support? Was there discussion of the tradeoffs between 1.4 and 1.5's versioning strategies? I looked but I could not find one. I don't mean to naysay the new design since I don't know the history.,If you use the link to OtherPage and then the back button; the browser requests page ?0. The page with id 0 is correctly restored and rendered. Before rendering the ListView removes all its children and recreates them. This results in a new page version; which is correctly taken into account by the ajax link and your log output. This might look unexpected but actually it's quite common: the browser requests page version X but gets version Y as response. So what is the problem you're experiencing? Wicket does not (yet) support back button for ajax requests; see WICKET-271 .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And my data type parse show that all are in a string type. From this point of view; the normalize-space function is involute: string = normalize-space( string) If that I assume is wrong; you can't anyway explain the serial questions 2. Note 3: With Xalan 1.7; I think that the call of normalize-space break the search from the first three nodes <A><Rx><P><L l='d' t='d1'/>. This is the bug.,As I stated before; I tested your stylesheet with a number of processors; and they all produced the same result. There is no bug here. In the first case you think is bad; no nodes are selected. The normalize-space () function accept a string as a parameter; but you are passing a node-set. The standard XPath conversion is to take only the _first_ node of the node-set; in document order; and convert that to a string. The result is another string that has been normalized. In this case; the string value is 'd1'; and the comparison to the literal string 'e1' fails. The second case is similar. You seem to be assuming the call to normalize_space() using a node-set will somehow return multiple strings; and the = operator will use existential quantification and find that one of the strings matches the literal string 'e1'. Although that is how the = operator works with a node-set; it does not work that way with a function that accepts a string and returns a string.,- Add precision about system et executing files - Add bug_func.txt expected (if there is no bug) - I don't test with another functions (Only with normalize-space function) - There are incontrolled automatic wrap on file: = bug_func.xsl; tag xsl:value-of = 2xbug_func.txt (With bug working and ok) - Precision about system et executing files = The bug is working on Windows 2K and Windows 98 SE. = No bug with Xalan 1.5.0 and Xerces 2.2.0 on Windows 98 SE. - Precision about executing files = xalan Xalan version 1.7.0 Xerces version 2.4.0 ... = Dir of executing files: 14/01/2004 02:05 118ÌâåÊ784 Harness_1_7_0.dll 14/01/2004 02:04 1ÌâåÊ998ÌâåÊ848 Xalan-C_1_7_0.dll 14/01/2004 02:06 24ÌâåÊ576 Xalan.exe 14/01/2004 01:54 49ÌâåÊ152 XalanMessages_1_7_0.dll 02/12/2003 16:25 2ÌâåÊ490ÌâåÊ368 xerces-c_2_4_0.dll bug_func.txt expected (with no bug): @cas R1.a Ok:'f1'@cas R1.b not Ok (empty):'f1'@cas R2.a Ok:'f1'@cas R2.b not Ok (empty):'f1'@cas R3.a Ok:'f1'@cas R3.b Ok:'f1'@,Created an attachment (id=10232) bug_func.xml (test file),I ran your stylesheet using Xalan-C 1.7; Saxon 6.5.2; msxsl 4.0; and xt and got the same result using all four processors.

2463,,,,,,x,//he's uncertain,Added a couple small points I missed before; and fixed (I hope) some formatting. Thanks. If anyone notices any misuses of the document formatting please let me know. Thanks!,A better update; still probably could use some polish. Let me know what you think. Thanks!,I might update a few more parts of this patch I wanted to fix; if anyone is thinking of committing; maybe give me a few days here to do more of an overhaul. I am trying to leave the AMRMProtocol/ApplicationMaster stuff alone so that part can be updated when the AMClientImpl API is in the code (version 2.0.4 I think? Later?) Anyway; point being I'm trying to clarify and update the parts that are outdated or where a better API exists as of 2.0.3 or higher in this patch. If thats a bad idea; or there's other stuff you want changed while I'm in there; please feel free to drop me a line. Thanks! updated patch will be forthcoming...,I decided to take a whack at updating these for the YarnClientImpl stuff; this could (after review and fixes) go in now; before the AMClientImpl is in; or we can wait on this. Your call. Thanks!,I agree. Its painful to wait but this won't get done very often and having used the old and new APIs now; I would say this is worth waiting for. An overhaul of that document is a must in the near future; though!,YARN-417 is adding an async AMRMClient to simplify writing apps; so it might be good to incorporate that when it's finished.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65869,,,,,,,,please apply these two patches in the $SMX4.0/runtime/trunk & $SMX4.0/nmr/trunk respectively. As Guillaume's mentioned above: Define a deploymentListener in the filemonitor module. Define a JBI artifactDeployment Listener for dealing with JBI artifact; to transform it to OSGified bundle automatically. With these two little patch; users can put JBI artifact in the deploy folder directly to install & start it.,Sounds good. I think it's better than having people run an offline tool. Though maybe we could add this transformation automatically somehow. I mean; we may want to support WARs too at some point; and we will have the same kind of problems. So we need a way to plug in some transformations inside the file monitor maybe (instead of having lots of different deploy folders). Maybe you could have a look at that ? I think we need to define an interface like: public interface DeploymentListener {      /**       * Returns true if the listener can process the given file       */      boolean canHandle(File artifact);      /**      * Process the given file (canHandle returned true previously)      * Can return <null> or a pointer to a transformed file.      */     File handle(File artifact);       }  This interface could be defined in the FileMonitor bundle and the OSGi deployer could register one. We could also add one later for WAR deployments. Thoughts ?,I'd like the 2nd solution; we can keep an separate directory for storing 'pure JBI artifacts'; and then if users want to deploy the JBI artifact; then just simply copy it to the JBI-specific folder; and that's all. JBI offline tool for users are transparent. I have following user scenarios in my mind. Users would use OSGi OBR to install the sharedlibrary & component from Gshell console. Users would deploy their own SA; and simply copy it to the JBI-specific folder. and that's all. Any potential problems or cons on this approach??,Good question. I'm not sure too. I'm not sure how we want to release the NMR / JBI. Right now; I'm thinking about a simple collection of OSGi bundles that could be donwloaded automatically from the ServiceMix Runtime. I'm don't know how we can handle the shell scripts this way... Maybe we could think of another way to handle that: the jbi bundles could start a file monitor on another directory; where pure JBI artifacts could be dropped and the JBI layer would handle the transformation to an OSGi bundle and install it through the OSGi api.,As I looked at the servicemix-runtime; I am a bit unsure where the offline tool should be; in the $SMX_runtime/bin folder? But this seems belong to the jbi compatibility; not the runtime. Or how to use the offline in the smx-runtime??,Update the patch according to Guillaume's comment.,Good work ! Still; I have a few problems with the patch: i can't launch the shell script on mac (haven't looked why yet) does it work on other unix systems ? If you don't have any available; i can handle that the tool only handles components so far; we need to also handle SLs and SAs by extracting the informations from the jbi descriptor if available or from the manifest if not the shell scripts includes the version number which is a really bad idea; as it would require manual editing before releasing. There are two solutions to that: just rename the jar 'convert.jar' or use the the maven resource filtering to put the version number at build time (i'd rather use the first one).,little polish on the offline.Main method. Add convert.sh/bat in the distribution; also package the offline.jar in the bin/ folder; actually; I am thinking may be we can add another folder called 'lib' for storing bin's depened library?? The offline doesn't seem to fit the 'system' folder; which will be installed as OSGi bundle by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11149,,,,,x,,,I wasn't able to reproduce the problem with the attachments. I saw appropriate error messages; line numbers; etc. However; line number information was missing for the testcase idkeyerr10; so I've committed a patch which remedies this.,Doesn't look like it to me.,Is this the same bug as #5972? That involves a different function; but it's a situation where a function refers to an object that was declared in a top-level XSLT element.,See idkeyerr10 for a test case. We put out a suitable message; just not the line number. This is probably a generic expression-evaluation issue. In the attachment; the first argument to key is always a variable; so the name of the key being searched for is set dynamically. Somehow; the value 'N400561' (which likely came from generate-id) got into that variable.,Created an attachment (id=1084) this is the xsl. run it against the XMLSchema.xsd (schema for schema) from w3c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(as it worked out on the other regexp issue),Kudos for this catch; i think i came accross this once or twice without recognizing it; thanks!,Here's what I did in our app; in an alternate asset service implementation class. I just copied AssetService and changed the static DateFormat to a static final ObjectPool from Commons-Pool. Specifically; I used a StackObjectPool; as it is simple and thread-safe: private static final ObjectPool CACHED_FORMAT_POOL = new StackObjectPool(new PoolableDateFormatFactory(CACHED_FORMAT; CACHED_FORMAT_LOCALE)); the PoolableObjectFactory used is just a simple class extending BasePoolableObjectFactory and taking the SimpleDateFormat constructor parameters as it's constructor parameters. It then returns new SimpleDateFormat instances as requested in makeObject(). The changes to AssetService.cachedResource() are only in the IF block for the modified-since header: if (header != null) { DateFormat format = null; try { format = (DateFormat) CACHED_FORMAT_POOL.borrowObject(); modify = format.parse(header).getTime(); } catch (ParseException e) { e.printStackTrace(); // original catch block } catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException('error getting pooled date format'; e); } finally { if (format != null) { try { CACHED_FORMAT_POOL.returnObject(format); } catch (Exception e) { // ignore - no tear-down needed for returned objects; and the pool will just create a new one if it needs to. } } } } åÊ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15073,,,,,,,,duplicate of WW-1598,From the mailing list: when the 'targets' attribute is set to a parent element of the form; and the link is hit; the content of the 'targets' element is set to 'Loading...'; the problem is that doing this will 'erase' the form in IE (duh). So when dojo iterates over the fom to build the parameters; the form is empty (form.element.length == 0) in IE; but in FF the elements are still there. So; when you have an scenario like this; you can't show the loading text. Now the bad news; there is no way to prevent the loading text from being shown; I created a ticket for it the other day with a patch; but it is scheduled for 2.1.0: https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/WW-1570,I was able to reproduce the problem! Not that I'm happy; but at least we are on the same page now,I am attaching an 'enhanced' index.jsp file. Links in different positions; with different targets; some of them using filter script. All these links do work and submit data with FF 2.0 I tried to use it with IE6 - this time IE does not even make request after clinking on any of these links. IE shows error message about missing tooltip script even just after loading - before any action from my side. I am still using snapshot 2.0.4 downloaded last weekend.,I have no access to that dev machine here; will try to answer this question in about 6 hours. But I am pretty sure I tried to make some variants of that sample and use 3 anchors: inside the form outside the form but still inside the parentDIV - formId set outside the parentDIV - formId set I am sure it still did not work; but now I am not sure if it still did not append params or if it failed to meke the request completely. I will verify it later today and send some comment here.,That's an old problem and has been there for a while. Shouldn't be related to the from submit problem. I have a question; if you move the submit button (or the anchor) outside the form; and specify the form using the 'formId' attribute; does it pass the parameters on the request?,I do not know if it matters here; I will copy some info from the users mailing list that I made last week. I am not sure if this is the problem; or at least a part of the problem; but I get it also on the simple test page attached above. Fresh browsers; cache cleared; refreshing with SHIFT (/esu is my app prefix). I was running the sample using struts 2.0.4 snapshot downloaded from nightlies on the weekend. /esu/ajax/index.jsp <--- location of the test JSP file /esu/struts/xhtml/styles.css /esu/struts/dojo/dojo.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/browser_debug.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/debug.js /esu/struts/simple/dojoRequire.js /esu/struts/ajax/dojoRequire.js /esu/struts/CommonFunctions.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html/Tooltip.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/widget.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/_package_.js /esu/struts/dojo/src.js /esu/struts/dojo/_package_.js Messages on the FireBug console under FF2.0 --------------------------- But I also get some 404s under FF: GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html/Tooltip.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/widget.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/__package__.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/__package__.js Could not load 'dojo.widget.html.Tooltip'; last tried '_package_.js' [Break on this error] throw _13||Error(_12); Message from IE6 ------------------------------ Could not load widget 'dojo.widget.html.Tooltip' last tried '_package_.js' FF reports errors on the console but submission works. IE fails and does not give much more info. I tried to instal the developer's plugin for IE; but it does not give much more info here.,I will try on different locales; I guess that's the only difference; I also have Windows XP (I tried on Linux also). What find strange is that the 'targets' is used after the request is made; so changing the target shouldn't affect how the request is made.,Since the weekend I tried to reproduce the issue using the above 2 JSPs on 3 other computers with IE6. The configuration is: XP SP2 with all recent patches; latest IE6. If it matters - the locale in use is PL. I have this problem for about a month; since I started using this way of submitting forms. Issue with my original JSPs (a bit more complex than the attached samples) was reproduced on several other; remote machines. All the time it works on FF 2.0; and does not pass params under IE (makes request but does not append params). I understand it's difficult to fight against sth that cannot be reproduced; but the issue is there.,I wasn't able to replicate this problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Committed revision 453308.,See VALIDATOR-203 for Jira issue to RECODE ME.,ArrayList seemed like a 'doh' moment; but digging into it it's a bit of a pain to code. You can't use set as you have to use add the first time in an ArrayList; so the code would need a large change. When I was looking at this class there were a number of bits that were jumping up and down saying 'RECODE ME!'; so I'm going to apply the two patches above to get the bug fixed in the nightly build tonight and then I'll look into rewriting things a bit. ArrayList would work fine if the code was changed from set(..) to add(..) semantics; but I also think the whole thing could be simplified.,Please ignore the previous comment as to where I can get the fix. I did not see the attached patch file.,How can I get your fix? Also you can always use an ArrayList instead of fixed size array so it wont seem so hacky.,Problem is that in that method an array of fixed size 10 is created. The patch resolves this by making the size of the array be the number of '.'s in the hostIP + 1.

With this patch the users of make can continue doing the make calls from src/c folder as they were doing before.,I don't see a way in gettin this done; only way that I see here it to pass the location of the zkserver.sh as an argument to the TestClient.cc file. Mahadev said he will be looking into this.,Giri; thanks for incorporating the feedback. It's unfortunate though that we will require src/c based testers to set the PATH. As you know it's already fairly complex steps/dependencies to setup testing in src/c; this just adds another stumbling point. Couldn't you have 2 locations for the script? './tests/test-zkServer.sh'; which if found is used; otw just try test-zkServer.sh and rely on the path? I think this fairly simple change would allow what you are trying to do while not adding further burden on user.,Here is the patch which addresses the comments added by Patrick Renamed the zkServer.sh to tests-zkServer.sh; hence the conflict with zkServer.sh in the bin folder is avoided. Also restored the compile_jute check in the configure.ac by introducing a flag. If user wants to run tests directly from the src/c folder they have to export PATH variable as fuser binary is not available in the users path. (fuser binary sits in the /sbin dir). so adding tests folder to the path may not an overhead.,I think Mahadev's concern is the change: -#define ZKSERVER_CMD './tests/zkServer.sh' +#define ZKSERVER_CMD 'zkServer.sh' unless tests dir is in your path 'make run-check' will fail when run directly in src/c. In build.xml you are adding tests dir to the PATH; however for someone running make directly from src/c this will fail. Also notice that trunk/bin contains a similarly named script - so in build.xml you want to prepend the tests directory (zkServer.sh location) to the PATH otw it may pickup the wrong script. Also; the change to config.ac to remove the check for the generated code; why was this done? I don't think we should remove this; in case someone runs make directly from src/c (not build.xml) Basically we need to ensure that users of both build.xml; and users running make directly from src/c; are both able to compile/test successfully. Perhaps the PATH just needs to be specified when running 'make run-check' - ie update the PATH in the makefile rather than in the build.xml. I think this would address the issue for both users of make and build.xml.,I hardly changed anything in the Makefile.am so it should work with the same set of env variables set in the build.xml,does make run-check in the c directory still working with these changes?,this patch adds couple of ant target's to execute the cppunit tests.. To execute the cppunit test use ant create-configure-cppunit test-cppunit -Dcppunit=true create-configure-cppunit target runs the autoreconf and test-cppunit executes the test. Please review tnx!,Giri said he may look into this. There are a few pre-reqs to running the cppunit tests: 1) run 'ant jar' from the trunk first a) generates c/java source for jute; necessary to build/run the c/tests b) run 'autoconf -if' from the src/c dir c) run './configure' from the src/c/dir 2) cppunit is required to run the tests 3) on redhat I had to install autoconf 2.59_2; automake 1.9.4; cppunit 1.12.0 and used gcc 3 (3.4.2 to be exact) in order to run autoreconf/configure/make 4) from src/c run 'make run-check' to run the tests 'make check' will just compile the tests 5) the tests assume that the jar file for the server has been built a) some mock based tests are run that don't use the server jar b) some server based tests are run that do require the jar - see zkServer.sh in the test directory; run by the unit harness 6) afaik the only output of the tests is to the console (success/failure) there are two tests run by make; zktest_st and zktest_mt for the single and multi threaded tests respectively,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20968,,,,,,,,Integrated in Apache Wicket 1.5.x #54 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Apache%20Wicket%201.5.x/54/]) åÊåÊåÊåÊ,this patch uses a copy-on-write approach to avoid synchronization for reads. Only in the rare event of a yet unmapped ClassLoader it's going to be a bit slower. While the patch seems to work very well a second or third pair of eyes would be very well appreciated. This patch also contains changes by patch for WICKET-2875 and reuses an empty array (new Field[0]) for classes without any injectable fields.,cant we just copy the specific ConcurrentMap impl we need from google code and add it to our own package? Else we could just use a ConcurrentHashMap and then use WeakReference keys ourself (but then we need to make sure that we clean it now and then),It's not that we are completely against it; but we careful in adding dependencies. A rule which we treat more strict for wicket-core than subproject such as wicket-spring. But if there is a good reason to add a lib; we'll do. Since we are using maven; it's a clear benefit if that lib is available via a maven repository (such as http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/com/google/collections/google-collections/),OK. I've found another perf issue with @SpringBean. Switching back to a locator pattern (injecting beans into WebApplication bean only) improved throughput 5x @ 20 concurrent users. I am happy to help; but would need to understand your reluctance to use a 3rd party library; given the current perf impact. For the above; Google Collections' [MapMaker|http://google-collections.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/index.html?com/google/common/collect/MapMaker.html] looks like a solid fit.,Obviously with Inspector we can not simple replace Collections.synchronizedMap(new WeakHashMap()) with ConcurrentWeakHashMap since such a class does not exist. And we don't want to add a dependency on a 3rd party library just for that purpose. Since you seem to have all the tests and tools properly set up to validate; may be you could also provide a patch. I'm more than happy to apply it later on to the repository. Thanks for your help Juergen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10856,,,,,,x,,I think with the latest code; this 'pop' message should only show up if an AVT is used with an incorrect value. If AVT's aren't used; the error should be caught statically and you should see the message: Illegal value: sideways used for ENUM attribute: order. Valid values are: ascending descending. Do we have a testcase where the invalid value is in an AVT?,When an exception is thrown; it is possible that the push is not called although pop is always called in the finally block. I will post a patch for this problem.,The correct spelling is 'descending' and that works for me. (sort03; sort09; etc. test it.) Then I tried sorterr02; which has an invalid value for the order attribute. I got the correct message; but I also saw a Warning: popContextNodeList when stack is empty! so maybe we should try single-stepping through some of this code. (I was using 2.4D1 in my tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If so; the client is redirected there. If a redirect target is not provided; the client is redirected to the servlet context root.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62999,,,,,,,,@Noble Paul I cooked something resembling a backport here SOLR-3079,Yes; we can; can u post a patch @jason ?,Can we look at backporting this one to 3.x; given 4.x is a little ways off?,I have committed it to trunk. We may need more iterations to clean it up,This time use a factory to create shardHandler  <requestHandler name='standard' class='solr.SearchHandler' default='true'>     <!-- other params go here -->        <shardHandlerFactory class='HttpShardHandlerFactory'>          <int name='socketTimeOut'>1000</int>         <int name='connTimeOut'>5000</int>       </shardHandler>   </requestHandler>,Noble; the Jira issue is HBASE-3529 where much of the code is offline on Git because of the different pieces involved. That being said; I've linked the various Lucene and Solr Jira issues that are required to implement Solr in HBase; eg LUCENE-2919 and SOLR-2563.,Got a 3 day weekend; so I won't likely look at nobles patch more till next week - I def will still take a peek and weigh in; but this is simple enough that I don't mind if we just commit and iterate on trunk if necessary in further issues.,Jason. Open an issue and I will be glad to pitch in,@Noble I agree; I don't think committing this patch should hold things up. That was just a little note. I've been looking at implementing Solr into HBase and am worried [somewhat] about the ZK libaries. HBase + Solr can help with massive scale near realtime systems you've described; eg; HBase implements splitting; partitioning; a fast write ahead log; etc. Facebook has implemented the index directly into HBase; which probably offers degraded indexing and search performance. We badly need the cloud features now Right; many users are going with Elastic Search for the reasons mentioned.,Jason; Yeah ; it would be ideal. But we need to get things moving fast enough so that users can get the benefit ASAP. We badly need the cloud features now. I'm sure there are others too. We have clusters with 1000's of Solr hosts which are managed w/ ad-hoc tools.,I think it could conflict with other uses of Zookeeper when the library versions are different. Yeah - always a problem with dependencies like this. It's hard to say what direction we go right now though - some have argued even non zookeeper mode should be single install zookeeper mode instead. Has it's advantages and disadvantages I think. For me; I can really only take it an issue at a team; and while I hope to drive some more things around SolrCloud soon; it's obviously been a while. Others have some issues open; but more ideas are always good. I certainly agree that CoreContainer could be modularized better - would help for testing too. I have an issue to do this for the persistence code (baby steps ); but feel free to open further issues. I somewhat took the easy route in integrating zookeeper - there are certainly lots of improvements that could be made overall. And TODO's to finish - I think a couple guys have done a few from the wiki in various issues; and I know loggly has privately impl'd a couple from their talk at revolution (would be cool to see that come back; but I know they are busy guys). I love TODO's - minimal effort; but when you put one at a future pain point; your code doesn't look so stupid even when it's not perfect yet We should discuss in other issues though.,Seems to be fine. It'd be great to modularize Zookeeper references into a separate abstract interface (like what's done here); and not tie it to CoreContainer. I think it could conflict with other uses of Zookeeper when the library versions are different.,I can look at this latest patch soon Noble. We should also give Jason a fair amount of time to weigh in.,This might need some more cleanup; but I think it is close to a state where it can be checked in.,Even the checkDistributed() method is abstracted out to ShardHandler. The current HttpShardHandler (this is default) takes care of zookeeper also,What are the concerns with the latest patch? I can work on them. I guess this is the optimal way to resolve SOLR-2592,Same as the previous patch w/ standard configuration,Jason; the configuration which I have specified lets you do ShardHandler specific configuration. It goes well with the general Solr configuration.  <requestHandler name='standard' class='solr.SearchHandler' default='true'>     <!-- other params go here -->        <shardHandler class='HttpShardHandler'>         <!-- To be implemented-->         <int name='httpReadTimeOut'>1000</int>         <int name='httpConnTimeOut'>5000</int>       </shardHandler> </requestHandler>  Creating a new instance per request is not wise.,Does this patch incorporate any of Nobles feedback/patches? Any reason we want to create a new ShardHandler every request?,Hang - might have gotten bit by JIRA's new patch sorting bs - used to just do it right and I prob had it sorting wrong or something. Just gave it one last go and the patch applied cleanly.,Can you update your patch to apply without the hunk failures? Tests will not pass for me locally with the current patch.,I just downloaded http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk and applied the patch; and test-core passed. However the patch command mentioned specific hunks; though there was no .rej file.,So my bad - looks like this patch is for 3.x - need to do it for 4 and port back.,I've got to look a little closer here - there was a conflict on trunk - naively just fixed it to compile and now I'm getting errors that are perhaps ip6 related? Need to investigate. java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid uri 'http://[::1]:33332/solr|localhost:53574/solr/select': escaped absolute path not valid,I think this patch looks good; mark I think we should commit this soon. simon,No worries mate!,I'm guessing Noble doesn't have a lot of free time for Solr these days based on how much he has popped up recently. I'm headed to Germany for a while; but I'd be happy to look at this issue as soon as I get a chance. Might even be able to start later today if my final buzzwords slides start coming together.,Methods moved up into abstract class ShardHandler. All tests pass.,Here's a patch updated to trunk.,What's the status of this one?,Bulk updating 240 Solr issues to set the Fix Version to 'next' per the process outlined in this email... http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201005.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.1.10.1005251052040.24672@radix.cryptio.net%3E Selection criteria was 'Unresolved' with a Fix Version of 1.5; 1.6; 3.1; or 4.0. email notifications were suppressed. A unique token for finding these 240 issues in the future: hossversioncleanup20100527,Still needs to eliminate the ResponseBuildr#shards field. We have no means of knowing the no:of of shards available in the prepare phase.The ShardHandler decides just in time the no:of shards available at any given point in time.,Search component is agnostic of the actual shards now. Some more work to be done to remove dependency on the ResponseBuilder#shards field by components.,sample of setting up a new ShardHandler   <requestHandler name='standard' class='solr.SearchHandler' default='true'>     <!-- other params go here -->        <shardHandler class='HttpShardHandler'>         <!-- To be implemented-->         <int name='httpReadTimeOut'>1000</int>         <int name='httpConnTimeOut'>5000</int>       </shardHandler>   </requestHandler>,The MultiShardHandler interface should automatically handle the shards and the search handler should be agnostic of the shard names . The MultiShardHandler interface can be simplified to this  public interface ShardHandler {     public List<Callable<ShardResponse>> submit(ShardRequest sreq; ModifiableSolrParams params);    },Same as the previous,Changed SearchHandler.getCommComponent to getMultiSearchHandler,should we have a separate plugin in solrconfig.xml like  <shardHandler class='ZkHadoopRpcHandler' name='zk'>         <str name='zkServer'>http://foo</str> </shardHandler>  and in the SearchHandler configuration it may have a reference to this  <str name='shardHandler'>zk</str>  This will help the Handler to have its own configuration,Changed the class names to the MultiShardHandler theme Added Apache license headers,Well; it's not always used in distributed mode (see MultiEmbeddedSearchHandler where we're querying multiple local cores); so DistributedCommComponent wouldn't work either. Maybe MultiShardHandler?,is it the best name ?. It somehow does not suggest that it is used for distributed search .,All tests pass (except the unrelated DirectUpdateHandlerTest),This code was originally created when integrating Katta.
