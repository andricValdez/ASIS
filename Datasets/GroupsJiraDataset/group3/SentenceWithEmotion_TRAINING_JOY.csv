456364_6,,,,,,,,,Can you show me which jira fixed this?

1720530_2,,,,,,,,,Committed to trunk.
1720530_3,,,,,,,,,Thanks Arpit!
1191390_1,,,,,,,,,I think your logic is right.
1191390_2,,,,,,,,,This is what I understand.
1191390_3,,,,,,,,,1
1191390_4,,,,,,,,,FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.
1191390_5,,,,,,,,,2
1191390_6,,,,,,,,,FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.
1191390_7,,,,,,,,,3
1191390_8,,,,,,,,,"In that case, caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level)."
1191390_9,,,,,,,,,Logically this is also fine.
1191390_10,,,,,,,,,NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.
1191390_11,,,,,,,,,Caching is a specialized function.
1191390_12,,,,,,,,,So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.
1191390_13,,,,,,,,,But it may not be appropriate to add this in NativeFileSystem classes.
1191390_14,,,,,,,,,"So the action items:
1. canDelete(), canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.

2065257_1,,,,,,,,,Applied the patch to implement Workspace.move
234857_1,,,,,,,,,We pretty much already had the interface we wanted for this (IFixedLocationResourceStream).
234857_2,,,,,,,,,I only needed to let MarkupResourceStream also implement it.
234857_3,,,,,,,,,"And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is

I dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache."
234857_4,,,,,,,,,"It seems to work fine for me when i test locally, the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access through

So if locationString doesn't work we get this:

1423534_1,,x,,,,,,,"Hi Suran,

The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good."
1423534_2,,,,,,,,,It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid.
1423534_3,,,,,,,,,I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now.
1423534_4,,,,,,,,,I will post my results when the tests finish.
1423534_5,,,,,,,,,"I have some comments on the new patch:

PermDescriptor

o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass."
1423534_6,,,,,,,,,"In my experience, this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used."
1423534_7,,,,,,,,,"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID""."
1423534_8,,,,,,,,,"o Once you do that, you can get rid of the getUUID(), setUUID(), and getObjectID() methods in this class."
1423534_9,,,,,,,,,o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).
1423534_10,,,,,,,,,"However, I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors."
1423534_11,,,,,,,,,I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.
1423534_12,,,,,,,,,But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.
1423534_13,,,,,,,,,This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.
1423534_14,,,,,,,,,"Don't worry, that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work."
1423534_15,,,,,,,,,"SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory

o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index."
1423534_16,,,,,,,,,"That is, the key order should be ( schemaID, sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName, schemaID )."
1423534_17,,,,,,,,,This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().
1423534_18,,,,,,,,,"But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName, schemaID ) which I'm not seeing."
1423534_19,,,,,,,,,"If so, then I would recommend adding a third index."
1423534_20,,,,,,,,,"Note that if you swap the key order, then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String, SchemaDescriptor)


o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors, one for each column in the table."
1423534_21,,,,,,,,,"See, for instance, the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory."
1423534_22,,,,,,,,,"SYSROLESRowFactory

o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory, I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array, one cell for each column in the table."
1423534_23,,,,,,,,,"DataDictionary

o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method."
1423534_24,,,,,,,,,"EmptyDictionary

o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String, TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface."
1423534_25,,,,,,,,,"DataDictionaryImpl

o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor(), and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods, so they should be revised to describe the new methods."

480162_1,,,,,,,,,It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11.
480162_2,,,,,,,,,"Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges, which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs."
480162_3,,,,,,,,,This causes pretty big data structures as many of our CMaps cover 65k possible mappings!

1114706_4,,,,,,,,,You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.
1114706_5,,,,,,,,,There are no extra lines of code or maintenance; it is the simplest solution.
1114706_6,,,,,,,,,"As long as the change is applied at build time, I don't see any real drawback.

1427702_1,,,,,,,,,"Changes to the test look good, and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct."
1427702_2,,,,,,,,,I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.
1673444_1,,,,,,,,,I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.
1673444_2,,,,,,,,,The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.
1673444_3,,,,,,,,,I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).
1673444_4,,,,,,,,,The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.
1673444_5,,,,,,,,,Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.
1673444_6,,,,,,,,,I've also started to add cascading configuration.
1673444_7,,,,,,,,,I've added a Theme class and a ComponentAppearance class which takes defaults from the theme and allows them to be over-ridden.
1673444_8,,,,,,,,,ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).
1673444_9,,,,,,,,,"I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far, but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next."
1673444_10,,,,,,,,,"In the new version, elements have two methods - render(), which draws them, and apply() which 
initialises shared properties like colour."

999352_3,,,,,,,,,HadoopQA uses -p0 to apply patches.
1453891_1,,,,,,,,,"Ok, got it, thanks for the explanation."
1453891_2,,,,,,,,,"In any case, the code for the toBytes method is written now, so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes."
1453891_3,,,,,,,,,"It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values, instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation."
1453891_4,,,,,,,,,"But yeah, that's for another JIRA."
145320_1,,,,,,,,,An example patch.
145320_2,,,,,,,,,"Was unable to run the unit test I wrote (because my setup is being a jerk), but I'm more looking for input on the design."
724751_1,,,,,,,,,"Thanks for the reviews, committed the patch to trunk"
289945_1,,,,,,,,,"Zdenek,

Thank you for working with these components."
289945_2,,,,,,,,,"I seem to be having trouble applying the patches, though, and I'd hate for all these corrections and improvements to be lost."
289945_3,,,,,,,,,Do you think you could submit a new patch in a single file (perhaps named with the current date) based on the current SVN head ?
289945_4,,,,,,,,,That would really help a lot.
289945_5,,x,,,,,,,Thanks once again.
739891_1,,,,,,,,,Rest of Ender's patch was applied.
451707_1,,,,,,,,,"It is good to know that pluto has a problem here, but I realy need servlets integrated pluto."
1984725_1,,,,,,,,,@Arnaud: My key looks exactly the same and was generated with Cygwin's ss-keygen.
1984725_2,,,,,,,,,"The file has Unix line endings though ...

@Lukas: scpexe works for me with M2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running (WAGON-27)."
677027_1,,x,,,,,,,"bq. OK w/ the latest patch all tests pass for me! Great 
Awesome! :)"
2113606_1,,,,,,,,,Do the same tests work fine on 1.5.0dev?
2113606_2,,,,,,,,,"One of the things I changed in jnr-posix, was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively, instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix."
2113606_3,,,,,,,,,"Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime, ctime, mtime fields)."
2113606_4,,,,,,,,,"Otherwise, the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok, apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end, which are not part of the windows stat64 struct, so will probably be filled with either zero, or garbage.

"
581437_1,,,,,,,,,Awesome. Thats great to hear!
1540427_1,,,,,,,,,"{quote}

Hmm, looks like the backport blew away scrubtest on 1.2 as well."
1645534_1,,x,,,,,,,"Great! Awesome!

thanks,
Dims"
1540427_2,,,,,,,,,Oversight?
1540427_3,,,,,,,,,"{quote}
Yes, was an oversight."
1540427_4,,,,,,,,,"Just for clarification, skipBloomFilters is old."
1540427_5,,,,,,,,,#1 and #2 are incorrect.
456033_1,,x,,,,,,,"Great! Awesome work, Nick, and thanks for the clarification, Bill. "
1540427_6,,,,,,,,,1: The skipBloomFilters gets called on the index file in RowIndexEntry line 104.
1540427_7,,,,,,,,,"2: In 2.0, the skipBloomFilters will be called on a 1.2 sstable; also, the skipBloomFilters currently is called against any sstable when scrubbing."
1186476_1,,x,,,,,,,"Great work...this is awesome stuff.
"
645538_1,,,,,,,,,I made a preliminary patch to share the idea how this can be fixed.
645538_3,,,,,,,,,"- This fix works if I run a ""mahout"" from command line against a Hadoop cluster."
645538_4,,,,,,,,,"A unit test case doesn't work; -Dkey=value is not parsed in ToolRunner but passed through to SparseVectorsFromSequenceFiles, resulting in a parse error."
645538_5,,,,,,,,,Did I make any mistake?
645538_6,,,,,,,,,Maybe because a JUnit doesn't really mimic a real hadoop env?
152270_1,,x,,,,,,,great. awesome job sergey!
412699_1,,x,,,,,,,Awesome - great stuff Maria.  Thanks!
645538_8,,,,,,,,,"- I was not sure about the convention of function parameter order, i.e., F(a,b,conf) or F(conf, a,b), but I just followed DictionaryVectorizer.createTermFrequencyVectors that places Configuration parameter after Paths."
645538_9,,,,,,,,,"IMHO, Configuration should be the first or the the last arguments."
883339_1,,x,,,,,,,Thanks for doing that Uma.
883339_2,,,,,,,,,"It looks like there is something about the build scripts that is causing it, because hdfs.proto, where NameSpaceInfoProto is defined, is more or less identical between trunk and branch-2."
675234_1,,x,,,,,,,Wow!
675234_3,,,,,,,,,Looking forward to using it.
1160849_1,,,,,,,,,I just committed this.
1160849_2,,x,,,,,,,Thanks Bryan!
1160849_3,,,,,,,,,Please submit new issues for the other aspects of this that remain unfixed.
915538_1,,,,,,,,,+1  Patch looks nice.
915538_2,,,,,,,,,Probably worth adding a third case in testDataDirectories for a URI that includes an authority (file://localhost/path).

911559_2,,,,,,,,,I've committed this.

914494_1,,x,,,,,,,It is good to have the test.
914494_2,,,,,,,,,I ran it on current trunk.
914494_3,,,,,,,,,"It successfully gets the expected exception, but then fails to close FSNamesystem with NPE."
914494_4,,,,,,,,,So yes it fails but not where you wanted it to.
777136_1,,,,,,,,,Please open using the JIra workflow and fill in the details.
2017630_1,,,,,,,,,"we improved hash handling in Railo, but we get not the same result with non ascii characters as ACF (with ascii characters everything is fine)."
2017630_2,,,,,,,,,"we cannot find a problem in our implementation anymore, perhaps there is a problem in he ACF implementation that force a other resultat.
"
1532956_1,,,,,,,,,This looks like it might be a blocker for release.
1332525_1,,,,,,,,,I didn't see anything in subversion?
1558641_1,,,,,,,,,"new version of 01 ""minifies"" type classnames for the standard o.a.c.db.marshal types"
572061_1,,,,,,,,,"Ok, thanks."
585405_1,,,,,,,,,Fixed in r1146573
527762_1,,,,,,,,,"Hi Christian, Jacopo,

Not sure if adding ""-Duser.language=en"" is the better way to go, sounds like a camouflage to me."

1153459_2,,x,,,,,,,"Thanks, Owen!"
1658827_1,,,,,,,,,Closing issue as per Luis.

376813_3,,,,,,,,,"its only tests, no source code changes."

222291_1,,,,,,,,,You are absolutely right.
222291_2,,,,,,,,,There must be some side effect in my project that circumvented this problem until 6.8.0.
222291_3,,,,,,,,,"Sigh ....

Do you think that is something that can be fixed in Wicket or some kind of IE8 madness that i should look to solve on my side?"

1065730_2,,,,,,,,,But why have you added testPropertyChangePropertyChangeEvent test?
1065730_4,,,,,,,,,Or at least has some relation to above problem?
928787_1,,,,,,,,,I will revert tomorrow if less-hacky alternative suggested above continues unaddressed.
1379319_1,,,,,,,,,Your explanation sounds reasonable and  the patch looks safe to me.
169292_1,,,,,,,,,+1 for the patch.
169292_2,,x,,,,,,,"Thank you, Ivan!"
1685349_1,,,,,,,,,After talking with Steve B. we decided that the DAS should insist that datagraph root is passed to the ApplyChanges command.

460822_1,,,,,,,,,The fix for test_no_extension was merged in PIG-2505.
460822_2,,,,,,,,,So this is ready for merging?
460822_3,,x,,,,,,,:D
1712885_1,,,,,,,,,This is now resolved in ActiveMQ 4.0 as we have a DemandBasedForwardingBridge which only forwards messages to another broker when there is a consumer for it
