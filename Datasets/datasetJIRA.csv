Oppss... sorry late reply.... Thx for handling this issue Claus. I prefered it to be the way it is now; document this behaviour as Claus already did. I think there might be both behaviour have its particular usage; if we want to have a param that is a string; it makes sense to use <param>...</param>; anything in between that's enclosed with %{} will be evaluated and its toString() called. On the other hand; if we want an object; we could used the value attribute. I guess what i'm trying to say is that both way of using param have their own usage. Of course this is just my 2 cents,-1,1
Bryan; I agree on the folder structure change. This surely will break existing code.

It is just resolved in 2.0 and the changes for 1.x have been committed at the same moment.

Hi Dave; Ã¥Ã I am not JIRA wise; I'll see if I can change the original; if not; I'll start a new thread. Ã¥Ã It worries me that the last binaries are two years old.

Also fixed in main 0.9.7 branch,0,1
First I want to verify that Gretchen's fix >Additional Comments From Gretchen Chiaramonte 2003-09-22 20:04 ------- for this bug works for me as well using Xalan 2.6.0. Second; regarding: >Additional Comments From Igor Hersht 2003-08-12 22:59 ------- ... >If I recall correctly we had such discussion before. >We consider that as a wrong usage. >The correct method would be to create transformer and >to do multiple transformations like >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); To help clarify what Gretchen has already implied; I believe that this doesn't complete the story. Xalan currently fails unneccessarily if 'xmlSource' is an XMLFilter chain headed by an XML source The XMLFilter chain should be reusable with only the source is refreshed. But at the end of the TransformerImpl.transformNode() call; the DTMManager is erased by the call to XPathContext.reset() as cited by Gretchen. This manager is what binds the XMLFilter to e.g. its stylesheet. Therefore; until this bug is repaired; the filter chain cannot be reused. That's a shame because I suspect that setting up the filter chain (eg reading the stylesheet from disk) is more work than constructing the transformer. In case it isn't obvious; a workaround re-creates the XMLFilter chain each time is it transformed. I did not find this bug report at first. Sorting out why I was getting a NullPointerException was a lot of work; partly because Xalan is built in to the JDK runtime but the 'endorsed' jar files are stored in common/endorsed under tomcat rather than JDK's endorsed (surprise ;-). In addition; Xalan has another bug in DTMManagerDefault.getDTM() (incorrectly returns the null this thread discusses) and one in TransformerImpl.run() (inappropriate throw calls). I will enter these as new bugs.,0,1

Just an idea: how about treating a jar as versioned resource? For example in my case that would work beautifully: my star rating component was in its own jar file; so everything would have the same version somewhere above; and all the relative URLs would resolve just fine. Since jar is pretty much invisible at runtime maybe we can have some version marker inside package; and then version in the URL can be at the level; so all other relative URLs inside package would work fine below that level. That might make sense for other cases: for example a skin for application where bunch of images and css and scripts can be packaged.,0,1

reg_name has been accepted as valid URI syntax since Xerces 2.6.0. This may change in the future if XML Schema 1.0 moves up to the RFC 3986 syntax which excludes this production.

Updated version of the patch. Removed the setter for the log storage provider in the stanza relay; and passed it either as constructor parameter of through provider registry as with other providers.

Out of curiosity; could we save a FOLLOWING notification as our lastMessage then; even if we don't send it? That would give you the 'current' state more accurately than a stale LOOKING notification and it seems like it could solve this particular problem. We could; but that wouldn't give an accurate state as well. A peer might be in the LOOKING state (next FLE round) while the lastMessage gets sent. There will be race conditions. In my opinion; a better way of doing this is to send the current state instead of lastMessage. In which case; I agree with Flavio that sending the final notifications won't be necessary. This will also reduce the number of notifications exchanged.,-1,1

Marshall; I'm wondering if the bug has something to do with the following: when you create a client; the second parameter to the constructor determines the random seed used by the client.

Do we have a testcase where the invalid value is in an AVT?,-1,1

The author would be Ted, really his call. If it's more of an example for the book, it could be attached to the book. If it stays that's cool too, just need to have a think about fixing/documenting the issues raised here.

You've raised a different an interesting point about performance though. You find that the slow-down is actually in addToVector, where it converts a String to byte[]? The thing is, the corresponding line in the ""fast"" version skips this step and adds null.

Indeed, also passing null in the ""normal"" version makes it twice as fast for me. It's still twice as slow as the ""fast"" version though. But I do wonder whether the example deserves a bit more attention. I may not know what I'm doing. Is that a difference that shouldn't exist between the two benchmarks?",0,2

"[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.

Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example, OutputStats is not completed abstracted out, as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though, and it would be appropriate to put into trunk, but these are not my decisions to make. 

With regard to public methods that were changed, I don't think most of them are a big deal, besides as Cheolsoo said, the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw, but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project. 

However, the change from JobStats to MRJobStats, while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user), could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.",1,2

...but even if we don't do that, i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations.
{quote}

I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting, not to be a huge data-structure holder.

While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms), I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.

Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim, which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields). 

So, I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting, I'm interested.

I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName?
{quote}

It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!), but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName, Codec.listAllCodecs, ...).

Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in
your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.

So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily, they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars), are automatically available this way.

I think Uwe mentioned this idea before, though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)

Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... ",1,2

Not that CM cannot go on with the current way; but my point is that Luc and you are focusing on top-level users while stressing that CM in a low-level component. To me, that is a blatant contradiction that produces drawbacks which I presented in several usage examples (which you didn't address), while you always reply with a single use case where the user is yourself (i.e. a CM developer). Anyone else who is using a high-level application based on CM will be baffled by the ""detailed exception message"" because, in all but the most trivial case, his actions will have only a remote connection to the exception triggered by CM.
I'm pinpointing at a minute detail of the design of CM, explaining that it can come in the way of some direct users of CM. The current long list of errors is in fact imposing your view (of what is important) to future application developers. [As an example, let's say that someone wants to create a GUI (e.g. for the statistician referred to above), he will want to define his own detailed error messages to be displayed in the GUI with a formatting of his choice. The statistician will never see the messages created by CM.]
If a CM exception (resulting from a precondition violation) reaches the end-user level, it means there was some unanticipated problem in the call chain. And to correct it, one would need more than just the ""detailed message"": the end-user will pass the stack trace to the application developer, who will correct a possible bug in his code (such as a missing check of a precondition) or pass it on the the CM developers.

This wasn't a problem with my patch, right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself?
{quote}

Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So, no you didn't add this, but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)




Yep, that should do it, as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources, we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line.

Jonathan - are you still in the loop on this one?  What do you think?

Given the fundamental differences in what a ""string"" is across different languages, there's unlikely to be a clean solution that suits everyone. Having a backwards-compatible compromise that works is much better than having nothing, though.

"> Do you think attached patch is generic?

Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs, e.g., 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[], int, int) and seek(long)?

It also assumes a particular checksum implementation, CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others, that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration.

"> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349

> Would appreciate any feedback. 
I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads.
Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases, I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it.
I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).

Of course, I'm a newbie, but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed), not with Click?

Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice, but this one is not. Making it even more complex, is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.

From what I saw, one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however, Click should remain very simple, otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility, so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )

My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ). 
I think like this, are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). ",1,2
"> I've reading the specification and can't find any reference to transient session in Node.lock(). Do you mean that Node.lock() don't modify transient session because it performs a Node.save() internally (there is no need to call save)?

"1. My feeling is that ""if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"" is not necessary, since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution, but I do not think it is harmful.

2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite, because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However, it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call, similar to getRecordIfStored, it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.

3. Well, not swallowed exactly, but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize. In any case, the javadoc for Property.getLength/getLengths documents -1 as a possible ""failure"" return code, so it had to be tested. I think if Property.getLength/getLengths throws an exception, that is already correctly handled.

"Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:

- Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class
- Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each. 
- I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating ""formatValueList"" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss... 

As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method. ",1,2
Bikas -is there any reason to not make the {{close()}} operation in {{unpackEntries()}} part of the try/finally logic? Other than that it looks good to be -the {{Shell.WINDOWS}} checks ensure that the Unix untars will be the existing shell commands and not break anything  ,0,2
"bq. {{ catch (InterruptedException ignore) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); } }}

Resetting the interrupt status of the thread is a good idea when we can't just re-throw the InterruptedException, but IMHO we should in that case *also* throw a TikaException to indicate that the requested operation couldn't be completed normally:

{code}
...
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    throw new TikaException(""Interrupted"", e);
}
...
{code}

When the {{Process.waitFor()}} call is interrupted we can't just blindly assume that the process completed normally. Explicitly throwing an exception is a better approach in such cases.",0,2

"bq. Actually, DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware, plan capacity/failover, create firewall holes etc

Even if it were a standalone app, I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr, though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.

Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names, because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't, I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client, which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.

bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH â I'm not sure what value it will bring. 

I've got a sharded index; currently production is on version 3.5.0.  Full rebuilds are done with DIH because my SolrJ application can't touch it for indexing speed.  It does fine for keeping the index up to date with once-a-minute updates, but for indexing millions of documents per shard, DIH beats it handily even though it's only single-threaded.

If I could put all the DIH stuff into one central place, it might make it easier to manage.  I do intend to look at the DIH code to see how it manages to run so fast, so I can hopefully improve my own code, but I can never find the time.

"bq. CASSANDRA-2444 got in the way

I'm not sure what the right solution is here.  I buy the premise of 2444 that you don't necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when you're first starting up (warming up caches).  So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.  But, I'm not sure ""check every N seconds, starting M minutes after startup"" is great either because it's not something a user will just guess when he's wondering ""why aren't compactions happening yet?""

Any other ideas?",0,2
"bq. guess we need to supply a tool to rename sstables files if anyone is on longer names?

We probably don't need to do anything. I don't think anyone is really using names long enough for them to it the file system limit, the goal of limiting the names is just so to prevent this from happening but there will be no other assumption that the names are short from the code.

I also don't think anything will prevent rolling upgrades, do you had something in mind?

Note: I have a long flight ahead of me so I plan to update my last patch with both those changes, as I still like the moving of all the directories handling in a dedicated class, even if we don't support both layout.",0,2

"bq. Hmmm, infoStream is just for debugging... should we really make it volatile?

I'll remove its volatile...


Oh yeah.  But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems
like overkill in the name of ""purity"".


I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration
into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that
you cannot change the RAM buffer size.

IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can
change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect ""live""
while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think, secondary,
ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern.

"bq. I assumed modules doesn't need to be self-contained like Lucene or Solr. I can fix that by enforcing tools' compilation in that macro... I'll do that.
bq. Steve, will you double check again if everything works

Yes, everything works for me now, thanks!

bq. and commit this in?

Is there some reason why you can't do this?  IMO committers should commit their own work.

bq. I didn't put an entry into CHANGES so you'd have to add it if it qualifies at all to be mentioned there.

IMO this definitely warrants a CHANGES.txt entry.

This should also be backported to branch_3x.

bq. This reminds me of the ""infrastructure tools"" problem we had in Carrot2. We finally decided to simply have them as a stand-alone project living within the same repository space, with a stored, versioned binary artefact updated when tools had to be updated (rarely). This does version a binary file but you don't need to worry about recompiling things over and over.

"bq. I'm not sure I understand, are you saying that B would violate this, or just that the status quo does?

I'm saying B would violate this, yes. B was ""bootstrap from the right token, but if that one isn't up, bootstrap from any other token preferring the closer ones"", right? I'm saying we can't just automatically choose another token if the user didn't specifically say it's ok.",0,2
"bq. If you back-port this to 2.9, you can't use any of the java.util.concurrent.*
Very good point! - didn't thought about back porting at all.


bq. I'm not sure you need a separate SearcherHolder class - can't you re-use IndexReader's decRef/incRef?
I guess I did not see the simplicity the reader offers - blind due to  java.util.concurrent.* :)

bq. I think there are some thread safety issues.. 
this is weird - on my dev machine and in the patch it is not synchronized.. on the machine I run the tests it is. Anyway you are right.

super.setUp, super.tearDown respectively as per the idiom. Is there a

stick to the idiom.""

"Following the recent facets work, I think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things (in addition to what I described above):

* Make OrdinalPolicy an enum with two constants (ALL/NO_PARENTS). It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600), and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide.
** Rather, if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below, he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder.
** For the search side, he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)

* Nuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one, but it looks like we can get rid of it too.",0,2

"From the dev list, didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)

The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a âcloneâ of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB, if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory, your GC simply drives crazy â we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible, as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/â¦, which does heavily locking. In contrast, MMapDir is completely lock-free!
 
Until there is no replacement we will not remove it, but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. Thatâs a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. Itâs currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it, the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before, so you can allocate a buffer thatâs better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy, as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....

RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index, it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput, add MMapIndexOutput, but not based on a mmapped buffer, instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap â both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.
 
The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences, sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole âmessageâ on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs.....

I agree that we can reduce the code a bit.  However, I think that we need to keep the activate method as it initializes the servingXml internals.   I'm not sure about the deactivate method.

"Hello Oliver,

Sorry for the late response. I haven't had any time to look into this again, maybe it was a misuse on my side after all. Since I haven't been working on the project I encountered the behavior in for months, this issue might as well be closed.",-1,2
"Hello, 

Sure you are right here, I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.

As you (and RFC959) say, when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case, i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.    
 
   The sender converts the data from an internal character
            representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII
            representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver
            will convert the data from the standard form to his own
            internal form.


Actually , according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII , for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.

So I don't know ... Any way, this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.

My current analysis of this is that EMF forces an assumption in the two lines of XSDEcoreBuilder's createFeature method

    XSDTypeDefinition elementTypeDefinition = getEffectiveTypeDefinition(xsdComponent, xsdElementDeclaration);
    EClassifier eClassifier = getEClassifier(elementTypeDefinition);

that the type of an element is contained in the emf representation generated from the input schema.  So, if we could override getEffectiveTypeDefinition and conditionally return an XSDTypeDefinition from the metadata available within our SDO scope then we would be OK.

For the case where the type referenced in the schema was provided by an earlier XSD to SDO conversion I think we can retrieve this data, and then do whatever's necessary, if anything, to get the EClassifier based on that type definition (I haven't spent the time to dig into that as I thought now was a good time to discuss)

This wouldn't cover the case where a schema writer was assuming some types were available that hadn't been produced from an XSD,  but I don't know that that's currently a realistic use case.  If my analysis is correct we could lobby EMF to make a change so that the above two lines were incorporated into a single protected method call that didn't require the EClassifier lookup to proceed via an XSDTypeDefinition instance. Then our override would be able to return an EClassifier based on the xsdComponent and xsdElementDeclaration directly.

What do you think?  Have I missed a/the point here?

I think that what you are saying is right and i find ( despite is on the specification or not ) that to have the error status
is quite useful.

But i don't agree that if InOnly MEP terminate with an ERROR status it should propagated back.

I agree totally with Gianfranco this should be done only when we're working in sync mode, otherwise it's better not 
to propagate the error back and use feature like restart from the failure point, that we've just implemeted.

Do you agree with this??

In general, I think this splitting should be in LedgerFragmentReplicator, rather than BookKeeperAdmin. This way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata. It will make control flow a little more complex as you'll have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current, but i think it would encapsulate things a bit better.

Yes, in general, all the split logic should be in LFR. I might pushed that code to BKAdmin because, I don't want to disturb admin key flow much, which will go through LFR.
Now anyway, I moved that logic, still not disturbing BKAdmin key flows in anyway.

"Hi Manjula, I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below.

1) I think this code

+        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null;
+        int port = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getPort();
+        String hostName = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getHostName();
+        serverControl = new NetworkServerControl(InetAddress
+                .getByName(hostName), port);// initialized for the shutdown.

could be replaced by a call to NetworkServerTestSetup.getNetworkServerControl()

2)
+        try {
+            serverControl.shutdown();
+        } catch (Exception e) {
+            fail(""Unexpected exception"" + e.getMessage());
+            e.printStackTrace();
+        }

e.printStackTrace() won't ever be called, since it's placed right after a call to fail(). Anyway, I think it is better just to remove the try/catch/fail and let JUnit handle the exception itself.

3) I can't see that getNewPort() is used, so it's probably best to remove it.

4) It looks like most of the changes in TestConfiguration.java are reformatting/white-space changes. If you could post a new patch which only contained what's actually changed, it would be easier to review those changes.",1,2
"Hi Michael,
thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.

I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.

I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)).
Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist, because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).

My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check). 
Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like 

   ...
        if (manager.getCopyNew()) {
            int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length];
            for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++)
                fields[i] = i;
            newInstance.pcCopyFields(pc, fields);
        }
   ...

This solution works for my testcase.

As an alternative you can modify (or add an additional) newInstance to copy the data.

I have no real experience with OpenJPA. Perhaps there is a much better solution.

The code I have, as written, does have the pluggable handler notion, since I didn't want to arbitrarily couple the XMLBuffer class implementation (or worse, it's interface) to the scanner. I didn't go so overboard as to allow multiple registered handlers, or anything like that; this seemed simple enough without being a hack.

Yes, this is where I implemented the full-handler invocation. It's more or less as you describe. Once I get everything cleaned up, I'll post the patch here; you'll probably find it to be entirely unsurprising.

I think what I'll end up doing to allow user-configurable buffer size limit will be to add a setter method on Parser and AbstractDOMParser, something like setInputBufferSize(). I think that would be most consistent with the existing API. Sound ok?",1,2

I assume you're referring to this code which checks the character offset and produces progress events if the XMLLocator has advanced at least 2K:

        if(locator.getCharacterOffset() == 0) {
            reportProgressEvents();
            nextCharOffset += 2048;
        }else if(locator.getCharacterOffset() > nextCharOffset) {
            reportProgressEvents();
            nextCharOffset += 2048;

        //Call the AbstractDOMParser.startElement()
        super.startElement(element, attributes, augs);

"Hudson does not work well, patch has been manually tested.",0,2
hudson was hung just now for 7 hours in TestHRegion.  TestHRegion is unorthodox -- intentionally -- in that it doesn't use inherit from HBaseClusterTestCase so it didn't pick up the changes made w/ mhbc.patch.  Hopefully its this anomaly that was responsible for the hang.  Attaching a patch that has TestHRegion do like the rest of the hbase (and hadoop dfs) tests shutting down the filesystem first and then the dfs cluster.,0,2

"I apologize for taking so long to get to reviewing this.

This has some good elements but also quite a few problems.  Here are a few suggestions.

1. The bindingGBeans do not need to know the name of the gbean they are getting something to bind into jndi from, they need a reference to it.  Similarly they do not need to bind a naming Reference, they can bind the object itself.  For instance, the connector binding gbean can do something like this:

private final ManagedConnectionFactoryWrapper managedConnectionFactoryWrapper; // this is the reference to the gbean that gives us the connection factory to bind

...

//now it's time to bind the connection factory

Object connectionFactory = managedConnectionFactoryWrapper.$getResource();
globalContext.bind(jndiName, connectionFactory);

This is also going to affect how the builders set up the binding gbeans: they know the name of the appropriate gbean such as managedConnectionFactoryWrapper, since they just created it, so they need to use that name to set the reference pattern in the binding gbean.  The binding gbean will then get (a proxy to) the ""real"" gbean that it can use as outlined above.

2. I don't see an implementation of a writable thread safe jndi Context, as dain pointed out you would need.

3. The zip file consists almost entirely of irrelevant files and the actual source files do not all appear to be in the geronimo project structure.  This makes it extremely hard to figure out what to look at.

4. Some of the code modifications (such as to ServiceConfigBuilder) appear to be test cases rather than production code.  It will be a lot easier to evaluate your work if you keep test cases and production code clearly separated as is done in typical maven projects.

5. I think you will need to redo the openejb work after dain's reintegration of his container rewrite.

divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<String,String> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase, but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict, instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be.

I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate.

Am I missing something in your approach, how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach?

The Lucene.Net_4e branch should have a already have a snk. I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend, so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.

"John: first off, i want to apologize for the *extremely* belated patch review ... I know i told you i'd try to look at this months ago, but ... yeah ... life tends to get in the way of patches.

on the whole, things seem pretty good -- although you were still using an interface instead of an abstract class.  Having the main API for a type of plugin be an abstract class is an important mechanism to help future proof ourselves against possible additions we want to make the the plugin API in the future; if it's an interface we can't really change it once it's released (because we might break people Impls); if it's an abstract class, we can always provide a default impl for people.

the biggest concern i have about this patch at the moment is that there are no tests, and no example configs, so it's hard to be sure it's even working at all :)

here's what i see as the current todo list for this issue...

 1) there are some legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors that need to delegate to the SolrCore to get indexReaderFactory ... perhaps we should have a helper method that decides which SolrIndexConfig to use based on the ""name"" ?
 2) we need tests showing custom IndexReaderFactory getting used (even if it's just a mock IndexReaderFactory thatsets a boolean to show it's being used) ... this will also serve as a test that config syntax works.
 3) need commented out example of using a custom indexReaderFactory in example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml
 4) sanity check this against SOLR-465, make sure we aren't painting ourselves into a corner.
 5) we should make IndexReaderFactory use the AbstractPluginLoader stuff and remove the guts of SolrIndexConfig.loadIndexReaderFactory.  It looks like we'll need to add a ""single item"" version of load to the AbstractPluginLoader to make that work well.

#5 is something that can be done after this is committed, but 1-4 are pretty important.  If you can update the patch with some configs/tests i'll think about the legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors and try to figure out a good solution for them

"Noah said heâs going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch, but Iâd like to explain this for posterity.

make indeed throws this error, I didnât suggest it is a grunt.js error, but itâs the way we use Autotools. In particular, in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:

FAUXTON_FILES = \
    fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \
    fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \
    fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \
    â¦and so on

In that list, there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js`, e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run, so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain, why this isnât a make error.

"Not sure if the patch was pushed for review or not. In any case, fixing the build is pretty trivial, the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).

Other than that:
* I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit, not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0).
* I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw, but in the meantime, it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE).
* We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL), but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs.",0,2

"Oleg,

I agree, it does seem that the presence of the Proxy-Authorization header on the
already authenticated connection causes re-authentication.  So, for NTLM to work
the proxy-auth header must be removed once authenticated.  I don't think either
patch 2 or 3 handles this case, unless (in the case of patch 2) the host also
uses NTLM.  What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the
authentication has succeeded.

"So there is another thing here, by deferring the evictions to the
background thread you increase the chance that the block will be
tenured then it must be collected from CMS space, thus radically
increasing the GC complexity of the cache.  Originally when the LRU
block cache came in, it made my collections 10x as slow until I
disabled the block cache for compactions.

Unfortunately all these micro-optimizations might be falling under the
GC wayside.

"Some thoughts I had about this:

Overall, I think it's a good idea.  Seems like it's not crazy to add and would have multiple benefits.  Logical striping across the L1 boundary is a simple solution to both proactively handle splits and reduce compaction times.

Thoughts on this feature
1. Fixed configs : in the same way that we got a lot of stability by limiting the regions/server to a fixed number, we might want to similarly limit the number of stripes per region to 10 (or X) instead of ""every Y bytes"".  This will help us understand the benefit we get from striping and it's easy to double the striping and chart the difference.
2. NameNode pressure :  Obviously, a 10x striping factor will cause 10x scaling of the FS.  Can we offset this by increasing the HDFS block size, since addBlock dominates at scale?  Really, unlike Hadoop, you have all of the HFile or none of it.  Missing a portion of the HFile currently invalidates the whole file.  You really need 1 HDFS block == 1 HFile.  However, we could probably just toy with increasing it by the striping factor right now and seeing if that balances things.
3. Open Times : I think this will be an issue, specifically on server start.  Need to be careful here.
4. Major compaction : you can perform a major compaction (remove deletes) as long as you have [i,end) contiguous.  I don't think you'd need to involve L0 files in an MC at all.  Save the complexity.  Furthermore, part of the reason why we created the tiered compaction is to prevent small/new files from participating in MC because of cache thrashing, poor minor compactions, and a handful of other reasons.

So, some thoughts on related pain points we seem to have that tie into this feature:
1. Reduce Cache thrashing : region moves kill us a lot of time because we have a cold cache.  There is a worry that more aggressive compactions mean more thrashing.  I think it will actual even this out better since right now a MC causes a lot of churn.  Just should be thinking about this if perf after the feature isn't what we desire.
2. Unnecessary IOPS : outside of this algorithm, we should just completely get rid of the requirement to compact after a split.  We have the block cache, so given a [start,end) in the file, we can easily tell our mid point for future splits.  There's little reason to aggressively churn in this way after splitting.
3. Poor locality : for grid topology setups, we should eventually make the striping algorithm a little more intelligent about picking our replicas.  If all stripes go to the same secondary & tertiary node, then splits have a very restricted set of servers to chose for datanode locality.

says that you're using an old snapshot-version of shiro ehcache. This could happen with the snapshots since karaf simply takes what it could find in your local mvn repo.

"Sorry to be late getting back to this.  Been a very busy week -- just got some time this afternoon and evening.

The attached ConfigurableSimpleHTTPServer.patch provides facilities to fully configure a SImpleHTTPServer for production use.  A new class HttpFactory is introduced that is
  a) Configurable with the most commonly set parameters, like request core thread pool size, request socket timeout, origin server header, etc., and
  b) Specializable to supply factory methods to override all the default classes instantiated by SimpleHTTPServer.  This is important to achieve things like a bounded request queue.

The parameters are also all settable in axis2.xml as part of the http TransportIn config.

All axis2 tests pass, plus I've updated my application with a custom specialization of HttpFactory that is heavily configured and it also works properly.

I'd like to look this over again tomorrow, and test the axis2.xml feature (not tested yet), but wanted to post this first version now to get comments on the approach.

Deepal, Dims suggested you might be the right person to look this over?  Also, Oleg, I'd appreciate any thoughts you have.

The patch is against my local 1.0 repository, but I expect it will apply against the svn head since simplehttpserver patch applies against 1.0 (with different offset for the hunks in one file).  If there are any issues, I'll make sure it applies cleanly against svn head tomorrow.

CliTest and DefsTest generate compaction loads (in DefsTest's case, on the Migrations CF -- haven't dug into CliTest as much) that break w/ parallel enabled, although the test doesn't actually fail (argh).

Haven't figured out what's causing that, and haven't come up with a way to reproduce in a ""real"" test yet.  The DefsTest does mix lazy/nonlazy iteration in the merge, which may be relevant.

I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights, or, putting it another way, it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession, but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e., getSystemSession(String) is package private, WorkspaceInfo is protected).
I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public, but they're useful from within the core. In my case, for the GC.
I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace, but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing, but in the mean time that is what I'm using.
Still, I don't see why this APIs aren't public.

"Thanks Dawid.

bq. Yes, this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did, albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).

bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard â I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.

Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)

bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst â wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted, this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already, ehm, a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:

Well... it's tricky.  First, I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data, eg inCount, newAddress, etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<Int,X>) I think?

Second, the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading, ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.

But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack), and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...

One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading, and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord, write-non-ord, read-packed, read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).

It is public. Not sure about whether it is stable yet.

I'd tend to lean towards making it Stable to ensure it's never broken, it probably deserves that status given how central it is to the framework. Thoughts?
I don't see either 'audience' for this yet it the patch, maybe you missed it?

bq. Are MarkableIterator and MarkableIteratorInterface public user classes? The unit test for them (TestValueIterReset) implies that the user instantiates a MarkableIterator.

bq. I left all of the lib.db classes public evolving since they are used by various extensions and users. Does this sound reasonable?

"Truth is that, the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect, but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.

But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there, fine, I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though. ",0,2

"Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request, so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch, which I find quite elegant. 

Some improvements to the patch would be 
- make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable, and delegate version checking to superclass
- refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer)
- use Searcher, delete HitDetailer and SearchBean 
- Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality)
- refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean
- remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile, HTMLLanguageParser,LanguageIdentifier,... correct me if i'm wrong)

As far as i can see, we do not need any metadata for Solr backend, and only need Store,Index and Vector options for lucene backend, so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata. We may implement :  

Or alternatively we may wish to keep add methods of NutchDocument compatible with o.a.l.document.Document, keeping the metadata up-to-date as we add new fields, using this info at LuceneWriter, but ignoring in SolrWriter. This will be slightly slower but the API will be much more intuitive. ",0,2

"Vishal Kher to Benjamin, Camille  9:38 AM (54 minutes ago)
	
Hi Ben,

I was going to open a jira after checking with you guys.

With your solution won't we run in into the problem that Camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastZxid - 1? - Peer fails after taking the snapshot. The snapshot has applied lastZxid, which created a child znode. During recovery it will apply lastZxid, which will faill with NodeExists and we will increment the Cversion of the parent (after fix for ZOOKEEPER-1046). So creation of sequential znodes won't be be really sequential. This is probably acceptable, but should be clearly documented. If not, then from this bug, it looks to me that patch ZOOKEEPER-1046 was also not complete. We may need to conditionally update cversion.

 I think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots. It will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.I will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well.

Thanks.

It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool.
I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying.
The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated.
Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.

"well, if the user uploaded a file in the first FileUploadField, then it should be handled by the first nested Form, and if he uploaded a file in the second then it should be handled by the second, and if both ... then both !

If only outer Form process all the submit then I understand that it can be difficult to implement what I expect, are nested Form informed of the submition or not ?

"Well, since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked
out what you did. 

First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't
understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of
pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this
would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a
class in the scratchpad area.

One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user
of this class, when you turn on caching in this transformer, the cached contents
of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be
cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.

Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity
of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the
validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of
the cached pipeline contents itself, then if the validity by itself indicates it
needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline
validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your
component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then
 that does not make much sense to me.

Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to
discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic
IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need, no more no less. I'll post it
here if anyone want to use it.

I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in
that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included
content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.",0,2

Preferably, it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code, which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables, so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent, then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement, but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine, as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface, I can always implement my comparisons in another place, but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable, and one in the Comparator).

I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related, except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes, I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table.

Thanks Arpit!,0,3
I think your logic is right.,0,3
This is what I understand.,0,3
1,0,3
FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.,0,3
2,0,3
FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.,0,3
3,0,3
"In that case, caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level).",0,3
Logically this is also fine.,0,3
NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.,0,3
Caching is a specialized function.,0,3
So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.,0,3
But it may not be appropriate to add this in NativeFileSystem classes.,0,3
"So the action items:
1. canDelete(), canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.

"And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is

I dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache.",0,3
"It seems to work fine for me when i test locally, the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access through

cachekey -> locationstring -> markup

So if locationString doesn't work we get this:

cachekey -> cachekey -> markup

But i guess that is a very small percentage if there is even 1 on this planet...

should we include this into 1.3.2?",0,3

# SOLR-1131: aka poly fields is almost ready to go.",0,3
Please review.,0,3
# SOLR-1297: sort by function query just needs review and then can be committed.,0,3
"After that, we can add in the Cartesian Tier indexing and the Cartesian Tier QParserPlugin (after a little re-write).",0,3
Then we need pseudo-fields and we likely  want to hook in a per request function cache (maybe),0,3
"Hi Suran,

The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.",1,3
It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid.,0,3
I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now.,0,3
I will post my results when the tests finish.,0,3
"I have some comments on the new patch:

PermDescriptor

o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.",0,3
"In my experience, this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.",0,3
"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID"".",0,3
"o Once you do that, you can get rid of the getUUID(), setUUID(), and getObjectID() methods in this class.",0,3
o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).,0,3
"However, I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.",0,3
I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.,0,3
But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.,0,3
This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.,0,3
"Don't worry, that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.",0,3
"SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory

o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.",0,3
"That is, the key order should be ( schemaID, sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName, schemaID ).",0,3
This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().,0,3
"But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName, schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.",0,3
"If so, then I would recommend adding a third index.",0,3
"Note that if you swap the key order, then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String, SchemaDescriptor)


o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors, one for each column in the table.",0,3
"See, for instance, the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory.",0,3
"SYSROLESRowFactory

o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory, I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array, one cell for each column in the table.",0,3
"DataDictionary

o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.",0,3
"EmptyDictionary

o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String, TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface.",0,3
"DataDictionaryImpl

o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor(), and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods, so they should be revised to describe the new methods.",0,3

"Also #3 seems to be fairly simple with a single ""around"" advice in aspectj and a couple of lines for ajc target in build.xml.",0,3

You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.,0,3
There are no extra lines of code or maintenance; it is the simplest solution.,0,3
"As long as the change is applied at build time, I don't see any real drawback.

",0,3

"Changes to the test look good, and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.",0,3
I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.,0,3
I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.,0,3
The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.,0,3
I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).,0,3
The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.,0,3
Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.,0,3
I've also started to add cascading configuration.,0,3
I've added a Theme class and a ComponentAppearance class which takes defaults from the theme and allows them to be over-ridden.,0,3
ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).,0,3
"I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far, but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.",0,3
"In the new version, elements have two methods - render(), which draws them, and apply() which 
initialises shared properties like colour.",0,3
This allows for a two-phase rendering.,0,3
"Apply isn't the best name but we're already using update(), so suggestions welcome.",0,3
":)

I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.",1,3
I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace.,0,3
These are all svn file deletions which will need to be done by hand when applying the hand.,0,3

This annoys my suppliers a bit.,0,3
"I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate), but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).

"If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow, then in the metatables, doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row, we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent, we'd have to scan to the next row).",0,3
"If we redid the meta tables in this format, we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase, a scan as opposed to the perverse, expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region.",0,3
This issue is about changing the way we name regions.,0,3
"If we were using scans, prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward).",0,3

"If we had this in place, I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is, the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.",0,3

File formats are forever.,0,3
"More variations add significant, long-term compatibility burdens to the project.",0,3
We badly need to add support for a higher-level object serialization system than Writable.,0,3
But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats.,0,3
So I'm all for a more generic serialization API that can be used by MapReduce applications.,0,3
"I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems, as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues.",0,3
I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container.,0,3
Historically that's been Writable and SequenceFile.,0,3
"We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive, language-independent serialization system and container file.",0,3
"Our APIs should be of course be general enough that it's possible to incorporate different serialization systems and different file formats, but we needn't provide implementations of all combinations of these, but should rather direct folks towards a primary implementation.",0,3
Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format.,0,3
The Dremel paper (http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems.,0,3
The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data.,0,3
Changing serialization systems or file formats is a major imposition for many applications.,0,3
They cannot afford to do it frequently.,0,3
"We should provide a clear path forward from Writable+SequenceFile to a new system that's easier to use, less fragile, and language-independent to better facilitate a rich ecosystem of tools.",0,3

"The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages), but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.",0,3
"In the same vein, isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g.",0,3

   3a) Jar ids are mandatory.",0,3
"Instead, to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.",0,3
3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.,0,3
Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.,0,3
