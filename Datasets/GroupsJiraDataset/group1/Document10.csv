69146,,,,,,,,The fix currently transform the input source to a DOMSource. We could also handle differently a SAXSource.,The fact that it works for a particular implementation does not implies that it will for all. As the javadoc says the source should be a SAX or DOM one; i'll ensure that this is the case.,I think that the java doc is wrong ! Here is the code I tested and run perfectly !!! SchemaFactory factory = SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI); // Load a WXS schema; represented by a Schema instance. Source schemaFile = new StreamSource(new File('D:/ri.xsd')); Schema schema = factory.newSchema(schemaFile); // Create a Validator object; which can be used to validate // an instance document. Validator validator = schema.newValidator(); validator.validate(new StreamSource(new FileReader('D:/ri.xml')));,yes - from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/xml/validation/Validator.html 'Note that while the validate(javax.xml.transform.Source) and validate(javax.xml.transform.Source; javax.xml.transform.Result) methods take a Source instance; the Source instance must be a SAXSource or DOMSource',Are you sure about this ?? The Validation class accepts a Source object. Check http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/xml/validationxpath/ for more details.,I agree; the ValidateComponent SHOULD support all the Source subclasses - but it doesn't. As I said the ValidateComponent uses a javax.xml.validation.Validator which doesn't support StreamSource.,I donå«t think that this is an issue. The StreamSource could be an XML too. I think that the ValidateComponent SHOULD support the different Source subclasses. The validation is about to decide whether the content is all right or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15914,x,,,,x,,,Oppss... sorry late reply.... Thx for handling this issue Claus. I prefered it to be the way it is now; document this behaviour as Claus already did. I think there might be both behaviour have its particular usage; if we want to have a param that is a string; it makes sense to use <param>...</param>; anything in between that's enclosed with %{} will be evaluated and its toString() called. On the other hand; if we want an object; we could used the value attribute. I guess what i'm trying to say is that both way of using param have their own usage. Of course this is just my 2 cents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16927,,,,,,,,I'll update the javadoc accordingly.,No; you're right that it isn't WSS4J's fault how other programs use it. However; I find the X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER to be a non-standard extension made by WSS4J and I suggest it to be documented as such to lessen the probability that users of WSS4J uses it without knowing the implications. Regards åÊåÊMattias,It's not WSS4J's fault if other programs are calling the wrong API's...as Werner said; it must be using X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER instead of SKI_KEY_IDENTIFIER. The X.509 1.0 profile doesn't mandate using SKI as a KeyIdentifier; so it's perfectly acceptable to support the X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER behaviour.,The tool in question is SoapUI (www.soapui.org); and there aren't any way to set configure which key identifier type should be used. We should report this to them as well; but we'd still have a problem since our client uses yet another tool (from IBM I think) that seems to exhibit the same behavior and we also have other reasons to suspect it uses WSS4J internally. Anyway; in the 1.0 X.509 profile found at http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-x509-token-profile-1.0.pdf ; the use of an X.509 certificate is described as a ValueType for a BinarySecurityToken (Table 2) but not for a KeyIdentifier (Table 3); as far as I can see. Might I be looking in the wrong document? Regards; Mattias SjÌ¦lÌ©n,Just checked this: this is the WSS4J handler key identifier code 'X509KeyIdentifier'; the tool should use 'SKIKeyIdentifier' instead. Or; if the tool uses it programatically: WSConstants.SKI_KEY_IDENTIFIER instead of WSConstants.X509_KEY_IDENTIFIER The X509KeyIdentifier was defined in X509 profile of WS Security V1.0 (AFAIK not in 1.1 anymore) but this is backward compatibilty with 1.0 . Regards; Werner,WSS4J support several key identifier types; for example SKI (Subject Key Identifier); X509v3; thumbprint and others. It is the task of the software that uses WSS4J library to select the key identifier type; thus the 'Java based tool om Windows' sould set the correct parameters. Where do you (or the 'tool') specify which key identifier type (profile) to use? Regards; Werner 401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0#Base64Binary' > ValueType='http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401,Hi Mattias; I can't reproduce this issue.

48779,x,,,,,,,Thanks for the issue / steps to resolve. Pretty much did what you said verbatim. (as it worked out on the other regexp issue),Kudos for this catch; i think i came accross this once or twice without recognizing it; thanks!,Here's what I did in our app; in an alternate asset service implementation class. I just copied AssetService and changed the static DateFormat to a static final ObjectPool from Commons-Pool. Specifically; I used a StackObjectPool; as it is simple and thread-safe: private static final ObjectPool CACHED_FORMAT_POOL = new StackObjectPool(new PoolableDateFormatFactory(CACHED_FORMAT; CACHED_FORMAT_LOCALE)); the PoolableObjectFactory used is just a simple class extending BasePoolableObjectFactory and taking the SimpleDateFormat constructor parameters as it's constructor parameters. It then returns new SimpleDateFormat instances as requested in makeObject(). The changes to AssetService.cachedResource() are only in the IF block for the modified-since header: if (header != null) { DateFormat format = null; try { format = (DateFormat) CACHED_FORMAT_POOL.borrowObject(); modify = format.parse(header).getTime(); } catch (ParseException e) { e.printStackTrace(); // original catch block } catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException('error getting pooled date format'; e); } finally { if (format != null) { try { CACHED_FORMAT_POOL.returnObject(format); } catch (Exception e) { // ignore - no tear-down needed for returned objects; and the pool will just create a new one if it needs to. } } } } åÊ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80738,,,,,,x,,Rejected for 0.20. Allow me to clarify my position. I was prepared to accept this for 0.20. Right or wrong; it's by all accounts the dominant convention for similar .i files from other projects; and that's good enough for me. However! It depends on QPID-4207; and that's much too big change to dist metadata for our final release candidate. This will have to wait.,I disagree with Gordon. Generating bindings is a client development activity in my view. With the .i files exported in this way developing bindings is no longer restricted to those with access to the qpid tree; but the only requirement to develop a new client binding is the client include files. This strong decoupling is a very good thing from my point of view. Obviously you wouldn't export .i files that relate to individual bindings to the include files; but the .i that give the general typemaps that are useful for every binding and point at all the necessary include files seem like very good candidates for export to me.,Personally I find this odd. They are not needed for 'client development' in my view; but for generating the bindings. They are source components of the bindings not installable artefacts of the client library itself.,This is committed in r1420320. http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1420320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14237,,,,,,,,Resolving this issue as the original problem has been fixed. Please open a new ticket if you feel session invalidation should also be addressed.,After some thought; the above solution doesn't apply to concurrent AJAX requests from a single user where session invalidation wins. But I think this is more of an application design issue and not really a flaw in the framework.,Today; I would think most session invalidation logic is as follows (as described in http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11.1/docs/how-do-we-get-invalidate-the-session.html): // Attempt to invalidate the session if (getSession() instanceof SessionMap) { try { ((SessionMap) getSession()).invalidate(); } catch (IllegalStateException e) { log.error(e); } } Couldn't we doing something where the session invalidation is deferred? So instead of ((SessionMap) getSession()).invalidate(); we have getSession() .invalidate() which will defer invalidation until the end of the request; either by FilterDispatcher or by a ServletRequestListener.,The I18N interceptor in xwork 2.1.2 is now patched. The session object is synchronized; but this is mainly xwork may use other implementations than S2 SessionMap. However; I think we need to adjust the SessionMap to take care of invalid session exceptions.,MessageStoreInterceptor and many others share the same issue. ExecuteAndWaitInterceptor and TokenInterceptor both synchronize on the session map. I don't think synchronizing on the map will stop the container from invalidating the session between the two operations above. The SessionMap implementation contains a synchronized block on the real session object within the get; put and remove methods. The purpose of the Map is abstract the session; so shouldn't the SessionMap be exclusively responsible for ensuring an invalid session exception doesn't occur?,Would that really be enough though? Just because we synchronized on the object doesn't mean that any other code calling its methods would also be synchronized. I'm not sure the best solution here without leaking the session object specifics through the nice Map abstraction. Any ideas?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29936,x,,,,,,,To test this; I used an aggregate AE with a CAS multiplier that declared getCasInstancesRequired()=5.

81302,,,,,,,,Changes merged to the 0.16 branch; updating the fix-for version accordingly.,Reviewed by Alex. Approved for 0.16.,Reviewed with no comments,Thats right; if the priority differs then the decision can/must be made solely based on that since it means the entries are within entirely different QueueEntryLists; however if both are of the same priority then the entry IDs must be used to determine the relative position within a particular QueueEntryList.,Awesome...thanks a lot Robbie for the update...Now I understand the cause quite well. i looked at your CL..and it makes sense..I see that now you're actually comparing against the priority value itself; unlike earlier where the id's of the last seen/released messages were compared. Thanks a ton...I will try to play around with the updated code in trunk; and let you know if I find any issues (I guess I won't),Hi Alex; can you click the review button please,Hi praveen; The second consumer being present meant it would never work as-was; but it did indeed have nothing to do with why it failed to work originally; which actually seems to be identical in both test cases above in the end. The out-of-order queues (Priority; Sorted) make specific attempt during enqueues to ensure that when a message is added that would violate traditional FIFO behaviour that the consumer subscriptions are updated to reflect that they need to 'go back' and progress delivery from this 'earlier' point. This is ultimately done by leveraging the same underlying mechanism used to handle messages being acquired by consumers and then released back onto the queue again without actually being consumed (hence the 'released' field name references scattered throughout the process). There was a fairly clear defect in the way checking the need for such updates was performed with the PriorityQueues meaning it could fail to take the proper course of action and lead to the situation you observed; where a subscription had effectively already passed one or more higher priority messages and wouldnt be able to 'go back' for them meaning they would just sit on the queue. The update I made seems like it should fix the problem; and did allow both your examples to run reliably (after the modifications as mentioned above). In addition to the unit test(s) added with the update earlier; I have now also added a system test based on the process in your example which would sporadically fail to receive all the messages without the fix in place; and then reliably receives them all with it present. This is all on trunk now so you can try it out for yourself if you like. I forced the build of the nightly release job for the Java artefacts (https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/Qpid/job/Qpid-Java-Artefact-Release) to run early; so the broker artefacts at this URL should now contain the fix: https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/Qpid/job/Qpid-Java-Artefact-Release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/trunk/qpid/java/broker/release/ Robbie,Hi Robbie; Thanks for the update. In the second case; I meant to close to consumer in the failing test that I sent you. I've updated the test and added it again. Even when I close the initial consumer the issue exists. Would that also be fixed by your change? Thanks a lot for taking this up immediately. It'd be great if we can get this in 0.16. Thanks; Praveen,I have taken a look at this today and noticed an issue in the PriorityQueue; which looks to have been possibly highlighted by a change made since 0.14 to resolve a not entirely dissimilar issue with the SortedQueue implementation which was added (see QPID-3704). I have committed a candidate fix to trunk; I'll request its inclusion in 0.16 once I do/add some further testing; although it is Justins call whether it makes the release. The example for your second case wasn't closing its initial consumer; so this will cause it to hold a prefetched message. Both examples were leaving messages on the broker when they were 'complete'. Modifying them to resolve those issues; I was able to repeatedly run them both successfully with the above mentioned change in place.,,,,,,,,,,,,
23248,,,,,,,,Fixed in trunk (r555005).,Ah; I see. I was evidently being a bit dense before; sorry. Will get around to this later today on trunk and 1.2.x branches.,Palette is constructed using a ChoiceRenderer as the 4th argument. There are 3 ways to construct a ChoiceRenderer; two of those do not require specifying an id expression because the item's index can be used instead. This works fine in most cases but not for the Palette. When creating a Palette object make sure you use a ChoiceRenderer that has been constructed with the 2-argument constructor; specifying both display and id expression.,Sorry; I don't quite follow you. How is this unclear? You need to implement an IChoiceRenderer. This clearly has two method signatures you need to implement; which are both properly javadoc'ed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

70265,,,,,,x,,If I see it correctly; the current implementation creates a resource provider for each symlink - I fear what happens if there are hundreds or thousands of symlinks,I'm still not 100% convinced that a resource decorator couldn't solve the simple use case. I wouldn't go into merging or overlaying etc. just plain linking :) So; if you have resources /a/b1 and /a/b2 and symlink resources: /s/x1 -> /a/b2 /s/x2 -> /a/b1 Listing the children of /s gives you x1 and x2 - you could also have a non symlink resource /s/x3 there When requesting /s/x1 the resource decorator detects the symlink and returns a resource with the path /s/x1 but forwards all other methods to the resource of /a/b2. This of course works only for this level; so the question is just what a list children of /s/x1 returns or it is desired to allow deep links like /s/x1/bla/bli/blo which is then resolved to /a/b2/bla/bli/blo.,Here my naive two cent to this topic: Why not simply extending the existing JcrResourceResolver to make it recognizing sling:symlink (or so) node types and make it return the referenced resource instead of the requested resource. This way there is no confusion in what this feature does: using a resource at one location as a 'placeholder' for a resource at some other location. Here some use cases where this feature would come in quite handy: 1. Site Navigation: Creating views to the content tailored to requirements of certain groups of users. These views are comparable to database views with the exception that they are static: a subtree contains only sling:symlink nodes to build up the 'view'... 2. Reducing redundancy by reusing existing resources in a different context.,What I'm thinking is let's say... Node /b/bar has property text1='one' Node /b/baz has property text2='three' Node /a/foo has property text='two' Node /a/foo also has sling:overlayPath = [/b/bar; /b/baz] /a/foo.json will return { åÊ'text' : 'two'; åÊ'sling:overlayPath' : ['/b/bar'; '/b/baz']; åÊ'text1' : 'one'; åÊ'text2' : 'three' },@Justin > Any reason you couldn't have this be a multivalued property? I cannot imagine how that would work. Could you elaborate? Ok; thank you very much for the plentiful feedback! I'll take this through another iteration to incorporate your feedback. I'll drop the symlink idea in favor of the overlay mechanism. This should simplify the code a little and does make sense for me; since I don't have the symlink use-case at the moment. Unfortunately I don't have much time on my hands to work on this during my day job; so it may take a little while.,>> Just thinking out loud here; but how about *only* supporting overlays.

If someone needs it in the future; we can revisit.,I suggest sling:overlayPath for the property name.

Ideas welcome :) > ... one more thing: for us to be able to use this contribution you should upload it with the 'Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works' button checked. Thanks. That's a mistake; I meant to check this of course. @Justin I agree that shareable nodes could be an alternative way to explore this. However; the use-case I need to cover is creating a language tree in a WCM scenario; which can be gradually overlayed with translated pages. So the 'with exception of overlayable' would have hurt.,with the exception of 'overlayable'; don't JCR 2 shareable nodes accomplish the same thing and have the advantage that the post servlet will work on all members of the shared set?,... one more thing: for us to be able to use this contribution you should upload it with the 'Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works' button checked. Thanks.,Looks interesting to me .... @Carsten: I don't think ResourceDecorator would help here; because this functionality really creates a virtual subtree in the resource tree root et the symlink resource containing the subtree rooted at the symlink target. Some comments to the patch: åÊåÊ* As for the symlink query: I would look for sling:symlinkTarget properties and not the node type. The node type is mostly åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊinteresting for applications/administrators but on an implementation level; the property is what we are interested in åÊåÊ* sling:overlayable: I understand the concept; but: can we come up with a nicer name ? ;-) åÊåÊ* The ResourceResolver field of the SymlinkManager should be private. Access to the field for the SymlinkResourceProvider åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊshould be possible using a getter method åÊåÊ* SymlinkResourceProvider.listChildren should probably support non-Symlink resources; particularly if the symlink overlay is åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊenabled åÊåÊ* As a convenience it would be usefull to add the rootPath to the service.description property of the provider service registration åÊåÊ* Not sure here: Would it make sense to have the sling:SymlinkResource type also extend sling:Resource ? åÊåÊ* How is the symlink resource accessible ? Symlink Resource Access: Provided you have a resource /content/symlink with a symlink target set to /content/target. Thus accessing /content/symlink would actually return you the /content/target resource; which makes perfect sense. But: How is the actual /content/symlink resource accessible ? For example; if we want to remove the symlink or if we want to retarget the symlink ?,Thanks for the clarifcation. > Then if /a/foo has property sling:overlayable=true > (in addition to sling:symlinkTarget = /b/bar) > /a/foo/4/text is 'four' Seems like this could be very confusing...if you really need it; I'd suggest making it configurable and turned off by default. IMO symlinks should mimic what happens in a unixish filesystem: if /a/foo has sling:simlinkTarget = /b/bar; I'd like /a/foo and everything under it to be the same tree as /b/bar.,@Carsten I didn't look into the ResourceDecorator mechanism; so I don't know if the same use-case could be implemented that way. But if you have input I'm certainly very interested. @Bertrand The example you gave is precisely what I had in mind and what the patch achieves. Additionally; extending your example; assume /a/foo/4 has property text='four' Then if /a/foo has property sling:overlayable=true (in addition to sling:symlinkTarget = /b/bar) /a/foo/text is 'one' /a/foo/4/text is 'four' /a/foo/4/2/text is 'three',> ...JCR content from the sling:symlinkTarget path is then exposed below the symlink node... Not sure if I understand this correctly; can you confirm that the use case is as follows? Node /b/bar has property text='one' Node /b/bar/4/2 has property text='three' Node /a/foo has property text='two' Then if /a/foo has sling:simlinkTarget = /b/bar /a/foo/text is 'one' /a/foo/4/2/text is 'three' Is that correct?,I haven't looked into your patch yet; but what about using a ResourceDecorator instead of a provider - this avoids all observation stuff etc.,,

74301,,,,,,,,Applied in r648154. Thanks!,The OAuth parameters are always urlencoded. The question is; where do they go. The OAuth spec specifies three potential places: the Authorization: header; the URI query part; or the POST body. The latter location only works; however; if the POST body is already of the right type (x-www-form-urlencoded). The code currently gets this wrong (attempting to add urlencoded OAuth parameters to any kind of POST body); and generally doesn't let you specify which of the three places you want your parameters to go. After the patch; they will go by default into the Authorization: header; which will work both with GETs and with POSTs of any MIME type.,I seem to recall Brian mentioning that OAuth only supported urlencoded (using their strict urlencoding definiton) requests. Is this not the case? Maybe I should just read the spec; eh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'll open a new issue describing this.,I'm assuming that this has been fixed already but not closed?,You do have commit access; so if making _cycle non private solves the problem then I'd just change it. p.s. If MultiFormSupport does work out it seems more logical to just make that the default behavior in FormSupportImpl doesn't it?,BTW; the 'new' MultipleFormSupport is an ugly copy-paste of 'FormSupportImpl' mostly due to the fact that _cycle is private in FormSupportImpl Making it protected saves more that 750 lines... the other solution is for the subclass to also keep a copy of that field; when it's passed in the contructor - still ugly!,A recent step forwards (i hope) has been the org.apache.tapestry.form.FormSupportFactory interface that is now responsible for generating FormSupport implementations. This has allowed me to try alternative implementations; one being MultipleFormSupport which works by prefixing all form elements with the form's clientId (on render and then again on rewind) Here's how this would then be configured - overriden åÊåÊåÊåÊ<implementation service-id='tapestry.form.FormSupportFactory'> åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ<create-instance class='org.apache.tapestry.form.MultipleFormSupportFactory'/> åÊåÊåÊåÊ</implementation> I'm missing a few unit tests before committing :),Yep; this indeed happens... In tacos this was fixed by introducing a parameter in AjaxForm that would make name and id generation depend on component's idPath (instead of id) Here's the changeset: http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/tacos?cs=348 I'm thinking of a less intrusive solution for Tapestry...

15084,,,,,,,,Hellow; I have the same problem after i haved updated my libs. I'm developping a application based on struts 2.0.1 beta. It works just fine before i replace libs by 2.0.5. Original config of my application is from Struts 2 blank; so i've check all config files; and i find that web.xml in 2.0.5 doesn't have these lines : <listener> <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class> </listener> so; i've deleted these lines and my app works.,Thanks for the update,Sorry for the delay; had to send in my laptop and therefore couldn't be online.

With this patch the users of make can continue doing the make calls from src/c folder as they were doing before.,I don't see a way in gettin this done; only way that I see here it to pass the location of the zkserver.sh as an argument to the TestClient.cc file. Mahadev said he will be looking into this.,Giri; thanks for incorporating the feedback. It's unfortunate though that we will require src/c based testers to set the PATH. As you know it's already fairly complex steps/dependencies to setup testing in src/c; this just adds another stumbling point. Couldn't you have 2 locations for the script? './tests/test-zkServer.sh'; which if found is used; otw just try test-zkServer.sh and rely on the path? I think this fairly simple change would allow what you are trying to do while not adding further burden on user.,Here is the patch which addresses the comments added by Patrick Renamed the zkServer.sh to tests-zkServer.sh; hence the conflict with zkServer.sh in the bin folder is avoided. Also restored the compile_jute check in the configure.ac by introducing a flag. If user wants to run tests directly from the src/c folder they have to export PATH variable as fuser binary is not available in the users path. (fuser binary sits in the /sbin dir). so adding tests folder to the path may not an overhead.,I think Mahadev's concern is the change: -#define ZKSERVER_CMD './tests/zkServer.sh' +#define ZKSERVER_CMD 'zkServer.sh' unless tests dir is in your path 'make run-check' will fail when run directly in src/c. In build.xml you are adding tests dir to the PATH; however for someone running make directly from src/c this will fail. Also notice that trunk/bin contains a similarly named script - so in build.xml you want to prepend the tests directory (zkServer.sh location) to the PATH otw it may pickup the wrong script. Also; the change to config.ac to remove the check for the generated code; why was this done? I don't think we should remove this; in case someone runs make directly from src/c (not build.xml) Basically we need to ensure that users of both build.xml; and users running make directly from src/c; are both able to compile/test successfully. Perhaps the PATH just needs to be specified when running 'make run-check' - ie update the PATH in the makefile rather than in the build.xml. I think this would address the issue for both users of make and build.xml.,I hardly changed anything in the Makefile.am so it should work with the same set of env variables set in the build.xml,does make run-check in the c directory still working with these changes?,this patch adds couple of ant target's to execute the cppunit tests.. To execute the cppunit test use ant create-configure-cppunit test-cppunit -Dcppunit=true create-configure-cppunit target runs the autoreconf and test-cppunit executes the test. Please review tnx!,Giri said he may look into this. There are a few pre-reqs to running the cppunit tests: 1) run 'ant jar' from the trunk first a) generates c/java source for jute; necessary to build/run the c/tests b) run 'autoconf -if' from the src/c dir c) run './configure' from the src/c/dir 2) cppunit is required to run the tests 3) on redhat I had to install autoconf 2.59_2; automake 1.9.4; cppunit 1.12.0 and used gcc 3 (3.4.2 to be exact) in order to run autoreconf/configure/make 4) from src/c run 'make run-check' to run the tests 'make check' will just compile the tests 5) the tests assume that the jar file for the server has been built a) some mock based tests are run that don't use the server jar b) some server based tests are run that do require the jar - see zkServer.sh in the test directory; run by the unit harness 6) afaik the only output of the tests is to the console (success/failure) there are two tests run by make; zktest_st and zktest_mt for the single and multi threaded tests respectively
81122,,,,,,,,Committed to 0.18 branch r1366206,Subsequent discussion with Alan and Gordon has persuaded me to approve this change. It's not a strict bug fix; but without it; some kind of patch is necessary. Given that the change is isolated to the ha component and generally represents a low risk; I approve this for 0.18 (reversing the comment above). Reviewed by Gordon.,This is a defect; but one I'd characterize more as a functionality gap than an ordinary bug. At any rate; I think it's too big a change leading up to RC1; so I think it should wait for the next release.,Merged to trunk; awaiting permission for 0.18 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ r1361334 | aconway | 2012-07-13 14:45:23 -0400 (Fri; 13 Jul 2012) | 6 lines QPID-4107 HA does not replicate alternate-exchange Set alternate exchange on replicated queues and exchanges.

Yes (in answer to your first question); the alert box does pop up. Sorry for not saying so implicitly originally. Yes; I could put validation on the form. That's a possibility which hadn't occured to me. It's not going to be trivial to validate the field though; since I'm using LookupDispatchAction; so the legal parameter values are in the application's resource bundle; and the corresponding keys are already in the Map used by the Lookup. So if I do write a simple validator; I'm going to lose the i18n abilities; and if I write a more robust one; then I'm reimplementing what LookupDispatchAction does anyway. And on top of that; it puts another requirement on the user (to explicitly write the validation). Wouldn't it be more robust to just not echo the dodgy value?,On second thought; I think we may want to mark this as INVALID depending on your response. This is not a problem with the classes; but with the lack of Validation. You should put validation on 'method' parameter - does Struts allow validation on parameters which are not explicitly defined in forms?,I'll write up a patch for this ticket over the weekend.

On the other hand; the XML-RPC spec does neither allow to send custom elements (which might include the exception and be evaluated by the XmlRpcClient) nor does it attempt to specify the error messages contents.

discussed in the comments; this behavior can be customized in each deployment in the way that mostly matches the overall domain.,The purpose of 'enabled' is to inject a workflow variable into the running workflow instance so that it is up to workflow what to do with it: the default worklfow definition is just a sample. SyncopeUser.setSuspendend() is only called by the AbstractUserWorkflowAdapter as part of implementation of UserWorkflowAdapter.suspend() and UserWorkflowAdapter.reactivate(): its purpose is instead to check whether user has been suspended or not. In short: enabled is used to check whether the user is created as disabled or not; while suspended is used to mark an user that was already active but now is not any more. This difference comes into relevance when you consider that disabled users (not suspended) are not considered for propagation to external resources; while suspended users were considered; at the time they were active.,I created a Wiki-Page containing a sample workflow description and image; to show how updating of suspended users could be enabled: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SYNCOPE/Updating+suspended+users I replaced 'enabled' check in enableGW with 'syncopeUser.getSuspended()'. From my point of view this 'enabled' attribute is redundant and should be removed. I reviewed syncope core source code and as far as I can see; this attribute will always be (and stay) null; except if a new user is created by synchronization with an external system. But even in this case; I would rather call 'setSuspended(..)'; instead of using this 'enabled' attribute. If you agree with me; I could provide a patch fixing this behavior.,A common scenario for changing attributes of suspended users would be as follows: A new employee is announced for next month. A system administrator creates a new account for this new employee but keeps it suspended until the new (future) employee starts his new job. If any attributes (spelling issues; role assignments; ...) need to be changed before this user is activated; this would match this previously described usecase. And for me; this sounds like a rather common usecase. And yes; you might be right; that the default workflow needs to be changed for a production environment; but for people new to Syncope and just playing around with it; could be quite irritated why they get error messages when trying to change attributes of inactive users. Providing a default workflow capable of handling this; would prevent these kind of irritations.,I don't see any particularly useful or not useful allowing by default suspended users to get updated; hence for me this is a 0; customizing the workflow definition is in my experience one of major tasks to be accomplished in any IdM deployment; hence default workflow is likely to be changed anyhow. Consider that allowing suspended users to get updated could impact in propagation to / synchronization from external resources; especially when syncope user status is mapped to external resources' status: this only to say that your proposed change might involve some integration tests refactoring. Regarding your questions about 'enabled'; if you take a look at ActivitiUserWorkflowAdapter's source; you'll see that this variable is given as parameter to the create() method: this makes possible for caller to discriminate whether an user should get created as active or not. One can easily get rid of AutoActivate: it is there as commodity placeholder when more elaborated activation condition need to be defined. +1 for moving user-related classes under org.apache.syncope.core.workflow.activiti.user (thus preparing for org.apache.syncope.core.workflow.activiti.role for SYNCOPE-173),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63811,,,,,,,,commited a while back,Can this issue be closed?,updated patch that includes tests and better javadocs describing when each call is safe to make. This also adds a function: refreshAnalyzers() that reloads the anylyzers. This is necessary if you modify the schema fields returned from getFields() This does not add any synchronization; it just relies on things being called within inform(),If the fields are made volatile ; should it be ok? How expensive are volatile fields? I think adding copyFields should (for now) be restricted to use before or during the inform() phase. I would g w/ this approach.Making reads expensive is not an option.,Noble - I don't think your variation is thread safe. I don't believe it can be without some level of synchronization or volatile on the read-side. Since a truly thread-safe implementation requires slowing down the read-side; I think adding copyFields should (for now) be restricted to use before or during the inform() phase.,a threadsafe version of the same,This patch has thread safety issues if the new API were to be used from more than one thread; or concurrently with searching.,This patch moves the copyField registration out of a for loop and into a public function. The downside to this approach is that the dynamicCopyField array is resized for each new dynamic copy field rather then building a List; then converting to an array. Since this is only at startup and is likely an unmesuarable change (unless you have LOTS of dynamic copy fields); this seems like an ok tradeoff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29394,,,,,,,,Closing this issue - if more needs to be done; maybe it would be better to open an new issue - this one has gotten rather large,Enabled default messaging between colocated components using java queues. Removed conditional 'UseVmTransport'. Enabled support for setting number of listener threads on both input and output queues for colocated components. Modified reply JMS connection to broker to always send messages asynchronously. Optimized JmsOutputChannel.java to set the Host IP once in the constructor; instead of computing it for every outgoing message. Profiler indicates that computing the Host IP is quite costly. Modified global boolean flags to be volatile to make sure that the changes made are immediately visible to other threads.,Need dd2spring change to add a new property to each collocated endpoint bean which specifies a number of concurrent listener threads that will process requests. With AMQ the concurrentConsumers property was set on the MessageListener bean which is no longer present for collocated delegate. Collocated uima as services use a java queue and ThreadPoolExecutor. The latter may be configured to process messages concurrently in multiple threads. An example Endpoint bean with the new property would like this: <!-- ==================================== --> <!-- InnerTestMultiplier --> <!-- ** Delegate Endpoint ** --> <!-- ==================================== --> <bean id='endpt_InnerTestMultiplier_1.1' class='org.apache.uima.aae.controller.Endpoint_impl'> <!-- Broker URI --> <property name='serverURI' value='vm://localhost'/> <!-- Delegate key name or remote queue name --> <property name='endpoint' value='inQ_InnerTestMultiplier_1.1'/> <!-- Timeouts --> <property name='metadataRequestTimeout' value='0'/> <property name='processRequestTimeout' value='0'/> <property name='collectionProcessCompleteTimeout' value='0'/> <property name='concurrentConsumers' value='3'/> </bean> The value for the above bean's concurrentConsumers should be the same value the was previously set on the Message Listener bean of the collocated service.,Another problem with dd2spring. A message handler chain for an aggregate does not contain handler for processing requests coming from a remote delegate Cas Multiplier. When a CM receives an input CAS; it generates new CASes from it. These new CASes are sent to the client (aggregate) in a Request message. An InputChannel for handling messages from a remote Cas Multiplier must include the following handlers: 1) ProcessResponse Handler - processing Process reply msgs from the remote ( Needed for both Remote CM and Non-CM). This handler handles Input CASes returned from the delegate 2) ProcessRequest Handler - processing requests msgs from the remote (Only for Remote Cas Multipliers). This handler handles New CASes sent by the remote delegate CM. 3) GetMetaResponse Handler - processing GetMete reply msgs from the remote ( Needed for both Remote CM and Non-CM) Currently only 1 and 3 are added by dd2spring. Need #2 as well.,Found another problem with dd2spring. Inner aggregate bean with remote delegate is missing an OutputChannel Bean. This bean is required to send messages to a remote delegate. <!- ======================================-> <!-- Async Aggregate: MeetingDetector_1.2 --> <!- ======================================-> <bean id='asAggr_ctlr_MeetingDetector_1.2' class='org.apache.uima.aae.controller.AggregateAnalysisEngineController_impl' init-method='initialize'> <constructor-arg index='0' ref='asAggr_ctlr_TopLevelTaeQueue_1'/> <constructor-arg index='1' value='MeetingDetector'/> <constructor-arg index='2' value='file:/C:/dev/workspace/apache-uima/uimaj-as-activemq/src/test/resources/descriptors/analysis_engine/../tutorial/ex4/MeetingDetectorAndNoOpTAE.xml'/> <constructor-arg index='3' ref='casManager'/> <constructor-arg index='4' ref='inProcessCache'/> <constructor-arg index='5' ref='delegate_map_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='serviceEndpointName' value='inQ_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='controllerBeanName' value='asAggr_ctlr_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='errorHandlerChain' ref='err_hdlr_chn_MeetingDetector_1.2'/> <property name='flowControllerDescriptor' value='*importByName:org.apache.uima.flow.FixedFlowController'/> </bean>,I put this change in (to set lazy-init) and Jerry tried it and it didn't help. I'm taking it out; as it seems this isn't the issue (Jerry agrees). Jerry found another problem - Generated bean below refers to a non-existent bean aggregate_return_metaMsgHandler_TopLevelTaeQueue_1 which is a bean reference for the messageHandler property. The bean for JmsInputChannel is required in this case. This input channel is for processing replies from a remote primitve delegate. This input channel needs the message handler chain. <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <!-- JMS msg listener for return queue for: --> <!-- rmtRtrnQ_TopLevelTaeQueue_1_NoOp --> <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <bean id='asAggr_return_q_listenerID_TopLevelTaeQueue_1_NoOp' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.JmsInputChannel'> <property name='messageHandler' ref='aggregate_return_metaMsgHandler_TopLevelTaeQueue_1'/> <property name='endpointName' value=''/> <property name='controller' ref='asAggr_ctlr_TopLevelTaeQueue_1'/> </bean> Working on fixing this...,Marshall; the latest fix resolved the problem; but I have another one. Constructors for collocated Controllers are not being called by Spring during Spring container deployment. It took me awhile to realize that the most likely cause is the fact that Spring uses lazy initialization for beans. Changes made in dd2spring removed depenendencies which triggered Spring to initialize collocated controllers. The way to fix this is to add a new bean property for collocated controller beans ( both Primitive and Aggregate) called lazy-init='false'. An example: <bean id='primitive_ctlr_SPCM_1.2.1' class='org.apache.uima.aae.controller.PrimitiveAnalysisEngineController_impl' init-method='initialize' lazy-init='false'> ... Again this should be done only for collocated Controllers. If I am right this will force instantiation of the beans.,Ok - found a logic problem and fixed this. Please test .,The latest dd2spring is not generating two required beans for remote delegates in the aggregate spring xml. Beans below are *not* in the generated spring xml: <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <!-- JMS msg listener for return queue for: --> <!-- rmtRtrnQ_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp --> <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <bean id='asAggr_return_q_listenerID_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.JmsInputChannel'> <property name='messageHandler' ref='aggregate_return_metaMsgHandler_InnerAggregateQueue_1'/> <property name='endpointName' value=''/> <property name='controller' ref='asAggr_ctlr_InnerAggregateQueue_1'/> </bean> <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <!-- JMS msg listener container for return queue for: --> <!-- rmtRtrnQ_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp --> <!- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-> <bean id='asAggr_return_msgLsnrCntnr_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.UimaDefaultMessageListenerContainer'> <!-- Define number of JMS Consumers --> <property name='concurrentConsumers' value='1'/> <!-- return Queue --> <property name='destinationResolver' ref='destinationResolver_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp'/> <property name='destinationName' value=''/> <property name='targetEndpoint' ref='endpt_RemoteNoOp_1.2'/> <!-- POJO to delegate JMS Messages to --> <property name='messageListener' ref='asAggr_return_q_listenerID_InnerAggregateQueue_1_RemoteNoOp'/> <property name='connectionFactory' ref='qBroker_tcp_c__ss_localhost_c_8118'/> </bean>,Jerry tested the above fix; and found a couple of issues: dd2spring doesnt generate the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean in the Primitive Top Level sping xml; which should look like: <!-- ThreadPool Task Executor --> <bean id='pooling_NoOpAnnotatorQueue2_1' class='org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor'> <property name='corePoolSize' value='1'/> <property name='maxPoolSize' value='1'/> <property name='queueCapacity' value='1'/> </bean> This bean is required by the top level message listener. <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <!-- JMS msg listener container for input queue for: --> <!-- top_level_input_queue_service_1 --> <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <bean id='primitive_input_msgLsnrCntnr_NoOpAnnotatorQueue_1' class='org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.activemq.UimaDefaultMessageListenerContainer'> <!-- Connect to pooling task executor for primitive --> <property name='taskExecutor' ref='pooling_NoOpAnnotatorQueue2_1'/> <!-- Define number of JMS Consumers --> <property name='concurrentConsumers' value='1'/> <!-- input Queue --> <property name='destination' ref='top_level_input_queue_service_1'/> <!-- POJO to delegate JMS Messages to --> <property name='messageListener' ref='primitive_input_q_listenerID_NoOpAnnotatorQueue_1'/> <property name='connectionFactory' ref='qBroker_tcp_c__ss_localhost_c_8118'/> <property name='messageSelector' value='Command=2000 OR Command=2002'/> </bean> If there is a listener there should also be a corresponding ThreadPoolTaskExecutor for it.,1) I found that dd2spring was generating a message handler chain for reply queues that was including the handlers for the out-going getMeta and process calls - I removed these. 2) after some discussion with Jerry; I changed the logic in dd2spring for message handler chains; input channels; and listeners as follows: Top level has 'input' versions of these; co-located inner components do not If any delegates are remote; then those remotes have individual instances of input channels and listeners for 'return/replies'; but share the message handler chain for returning messages. If no delegate is remote; then no 'return' input channles; listeners; or message handler chains are made. Doing #11 above - change references to this output channel to null (actually; remove the <property ...> element referring to it,Sorry for the confusion; I meant to say ThreadPoolExecutor instead of TaskExecutor. Corrected initial comment.,In the first comment; change 'java's TaskExecutor framework' to 'Spring's TaskExecutor framework' - I believe it's an interface in Spring; and there is no class/interface called this in Java 5 or 6.,Since we are removing internal broker for messaging; dd2spring needs to be modified to remove unnecessary beans.

All files attached here have been generated after an update was done,Jerry; am having problems applying the patch files. Many patches appear to be against the wrong versions. Thanks; Eddie,Description of the patches in the previous comment. Forgot to grant license to ASF,Provided an alternate mechanism for messaging between colocated Uima As services. Instead of using jms based queues the internal messaging is done via java queues. The new messaging implementation uses java's ThreadPoolExecutor framework which provides necessary synchronization and threading. Each Uima As service uses a new UimaDispatcher component to send outbound messages and a UimaListener component for receiving incoming messages. Each incoming message is processed in a separate thread provided by the ThreadPoolExecutor. The number of threads used by the ThreadPoolExecutor depends on the value of the 'inputQueueScaleout' attribute for incoming messages and the 'internalReplyQueueScaleout' attribute for outgoing messages. Both of these attributes are configured in the deployment descriptor. ******************************************************************************************************************************* NOTE: The default messaging mechanism is still JMS using internal Broker. To enable java queue's for internal messaging use -DUseVmTransport=true system property. ******************************************************************************************************************************* Fixed Uima As controller code to enable support for colocated Aggregate Cas Multiplier. Merged Delta Cas changes Added new 2 testcases Added new API to the testcase base code to enable a testcase to pass exceptions it wants to ignore. This prevents the Exceptions from being printed on the stdout.,,,

Some of the ways I've thought about doing cloud in conjunction with nested documents and document blocks involves encoding sub-children as The original idea around letting people specify their own uniqueKey field and fieldType was that you could design a Solr schema that would be compatible with a random lucene index.

I should have added one; but have just had zero free time for months now ... Cheers; Nick.,The file I attached contains a tapestry project; generated with the quickstart archetype; that illustrates the bug. In short: There are two mixins: MixinBefore and MixinBefore2. In Index.tml; an 'any' component is given the mixins as: t:mixins='MixedBefore;MixedBefore2'. So MixinBefore is called first; and then MixingBefore2. MixinBefore's beginRender method returns false; this should short-circuit rendering of the body of the 'any' component; as diagramed in the component state diagram at: http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry5/tapestry-core/guide/rendering.html It will short-circuit it; but according to the last sub-section of the same documentation: 'Short Circuiting If a method returns a true or false value; this will short circuit processing. Other methods within the phase that would ordinarily be invoked will not be invoked. Most render phase methods should return void; to avoid unintentionally short circuiting other methods for the same phase.' This suggests that the MixedBefore2's beginRender method should NOT be called. So; in MixedBefore2's beginRender method; an IllegalStateException is thrown. If you start up the app; and go to the page; you will see that the IllegalStateException is thrown. As Nick pointed out; either the documentation needs to be fixed; or the code needs to be fixed; but they are clearly at odds.,Nick is right: the docs are pretty clear that subsequent methods in the same phase should be aborted; but they aren't; at least; subsequent mixin methods for the same phase aren't. I'll attach a sample project that illustrates the issue; generated with the quickstart archetype; so you can mvn jetty:run it.,This issue is not a duplicate of TAPESTRY-1805. In a nutshell; it's the answer to the following question: My component returns true for beforeRenderBody(). Should this prevent all other beforeRenderBody events from executing? If so; it doesn't; and is a bug. If not; the docs need to restate the short-circuiting functionality. Seems it's a bug is because of the comment next to the exception raised: åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// Given that this method is *only* invoked from code åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// that is generated at runtime and proven to be correct; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// this should never; ever happen. But what the hell; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// let's check anyway. Cheers; Nick.,Duplicate of TAPESTRY-1805.,Sorry; I should have given an example; but at the time I thought the bug was pretty clear. Here's what I posted about it to the dev list over 2 months ago: Subject: T5: Clarification on render phase component/mixin conflict behaviour Newsgroups: gmane.comp.jakarta.tapestry.devel http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.jakarta.tapestry.devel/20864/ Date: 2007-07-20 10:22:32 GMT (9 weeks; 1 day; 16 hours and 28 minutes ago) Hi. The component rendering guide suggests ordering and short-circuiting should prevent components and mixins using the same render phase from crossing swords; so to speak. Basically I've got a case where this doesn't seem to work out: AbstractField has a @Mixin DiscardBody. @Mixin DiscardBody returns false for beforeRenderBody(). (Note that @Mixin DiscardBody has a @MixinAfter.) My component derives from AbstractField. My component returns true for beforeRenderBody(). According to the docs I expect my component to short-circuit the phase and prevent DiscardBody's beforeRenderBody() from being invoked; but instead an exception is thrown. (Full stack trace appended below.) My expectation seems reasonable; especially considering the comment before the exception raising code; but which is correct? ;-) åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// Given that this method is *only* invoked from code åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// that is generated at runtime and proven to be correct; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// this should never; ever happen.

10134,,,,,,,,Brian; I understand what you say and specification about 'serialization' in XSLT not 'indenting'. As I saied before; indenting is just the thing that we easily see the structure and data of XML document. Xalan output is not easy to see that. The last; I think the example of non-whitespace characters is no relationship to indenting. non-whitespace characters must not be stripped; but whitespace characters could be stripped. Regards; Tetsuya Yoshida åÊåÊåÊåÊ,Tetsuya; a colleage of mine has this to say: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian; actually; the text you've quoted allows us to add extra whitespace between </b> and <c>. If whitespace stripping is on; and the set of whitespace preserving elements is just xsl:text; then both of the following would be correct serializations <?xml version='1.0'?> <a> åÊåÊ<b>b</b> <c>c</c> </a> <?xml version='1.0'?> <a> åÊåÊ<b>b</b> åÊåÊ<c>c</c> </a> because; when stripped of whitespace; they would both look like this: <a><b>b</b><c>c</c></a> åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊOne of the cases the text you've quoted was trying to restrict was the one in which there are non-whitespace characters involved. For example; when the following is serialized; additional whitespace must not be introduced between </b> and <c> <?xml version='1.0'?> <a><b>b</b>x <c>c</c></a> --------------------------------------------------------------------------- So this bug is still alive. Regards; Brian Minchau,Tetsuya; there is a specification about indenting. Unfortunately it isn't complete; or perhaps all that clear. One thing that is missing for instance is how to indent and what the indentation character should be (space; tab ...). But it does say something in section 16.1 of XSLT 1.0 ('XML Output Method') (http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt). Here is a bit of it: [[ The xml output method should use an algorithm to output additional whitespace that ensures that the result if whitespace were to be stripped from the output using the process described in [3.4 Whitespace Stripping] with the set of whitespace-preserving elements consisting of just xsl:text would be the same when additional whitespace is output as when additional whitespace is not output. ]] This extra whitespace between </b> and <c> is implicitly an <xsl:text> element with whitespace in it. The clause above in 16.1 applies; so we can't add more whitespace to the existing whitespace. The output of such an xsl:text element must be same as when indenting is 'yes' or when it is 'no'. If we add extra whitespace in this situation we can't tell later on if it came from indentation or from the xsl:text element. Regards; Brian Minchau XSLT Development; IBM Toronto,Brian; Thank you for your reply. I've confirmed that in.xml that you showed bellow was no problem. As you suspect; there is a little whitespace after </b>. There is no specification about indenting. In my opinion; indenting only make us see relationship between parent node and a child node easily. Following my opinion; in.xml that I showed should be printed as expected.xml that I also showed. In addtion; Xerces and IE are printed in.xml as expected.xml Regards; Tetsuya Yoshida,Tetsuya; I think there may be a little whitespace 'fluff' that I can't see in this bug report. I'm suspecting a little whitespace after </b> and before <c> Try your in.xml as this: ===== in.xml ===== <?xml version='1.0'?><a><b>b</b><c>c</c></a> =================== I'm thinking that this will indent just fine; in which case you have some whitespace in the file in the spot that I'm indicating. Regard; Brian Minchau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28313,x,,,,,,,Thanks for that comment Richard! I was laboring under the (false) impression that I could not change the docs that went with our previous releases; but I see these are coming from a copy on our svn site; and we could actually change that one. Anybody object to my doing that? I could correct the link; and also indicate this release is 2 levels out of date.,It might be a good idea to add a prominent notice to the old documentation pages that the documentation is outdated and also add such a not to the outdated update site links.,I'm not sure how to 'fix' this. The reference url to the documentation is for an old release and the link was valid while we were in the incubator; but now that we've graduated; we were required to remove our old distributions there. The new documentation (for releases since we've graduated) has the correct link. Does anyone know if there's some kind of 'forwarding' link that can work for eclipse download sites? Since this is mirrored; it would be good if the forwarding mechanism also worked on the mirrors...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

34486,x,x,,,,,,Odd that you can't get the attached to build as it builds fine for me with the current latest code; never mind because I've tried it for you and yes this has fixed the problems and it now works. Thanks Jim! (Side note; I agree 100% about moving all the non-Java container specific tests out of the java container project),I think I fixed the issue but I can't get the attached to build on my machine so I am not sure if the web services binding will work. I have checked in unit tests that rely on the foo binding in container-java that exercise this core feature: org.apache.tuscany.container.java.integration.binding.EPtoExternalServiceTestCase org.apache.tuscany.container.java.integration.binding.ExternalServiceProxyInvokeTestCase Ideally; I would like the unit tests to be in core but pending what we decide on integration testing; I did not want to duplicate the test binding in two places (test classes can't be shared between projects). If this doesn't fix the problem; can you send a testcase demonstrating the issue so I can help address it? Thanks; Jim,This is not a problem with the SCA Tomcat integration. This is a problem with the core runtime; similar to the bug reported in TUSCANY-123. Jim; could you please look into this one as well as part of your investigation of TUSCANY-123? Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

54763,,,,,,,,Fixed.,Following refactoring the logging issue is resolved but the setting null in the pageContext issue still remains: TagUtils.message call may still return null if the message resource does not exist. This then try to set null on the pageContext which would fail. The id should be removed as in the doStartTag() method: if (msg != null) { åÊåÊåÊåÊpageContext.setAttribute(id; msg); } else { åÊåÊåÊåÊpageContext.removeAttribute(id); } This way if a message is missing the resulting page will still render rather than experiencing a runtime error.

13658,,,,,,,,> Would it have an impact to remove this 'name' attribute from the generated 'form' tag ? YES! If you need XHTML strict compliance; just drop a new copy of form-common.ftl into template/simple; you can easily take out the section that generates the name=... It would probably cause us major problems; but you might be able to code around it for a single app. You can reopen as a feature request; but I think it is sufficient that you can change the templates yourself.,Ok; so maybe I should set the type to feature ! The thing is; from the test I made; most of the generated HTML code is XHTML strict compliant; so it would be very nice if all the generated HTML code was XHTML strict compliant. Would it have an impact to remove this 'name' attribute from the generated 'form' tag ?,I don't think strict XHTML compliance has ever been a goal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11881,,,,,,,,AFAIK; there is no plan to replace crimson with xerces in near future ( maybe for xerces2; but that's still far away). There are many reasons for that ( requirements related with code size and speed ). In any case; the dist from apache uses xerces as default.,To me there is one central issue - Crimson is being phased out in favor of Xerces. For this reason alone it should not be the default. It just confuses things. This is especially true for new developers. It took an hour of frustration to figure out why; when I pulled the xalan source apart and rebuilt it; Xalan wasn't working. I had to research issues that I should not have had too.,Costin should own this one. The basic plan is to remove the javax.xml.parser stuff from the Xalan jar; and let this be a parser problem. Personally; I think it's totally bogus for it to have 'org.apache.crimson.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl' embedded in the code; but I don't really want to be responsible for having a slightly different version of the code in Xalan than is in the JAXP 1.1 package. We'll leave the javax.xml.parser code in the repository for building; but I don't think this code should be changed.,The default factory specified in these calls is used only if no other factory specification can be found. In the case of SAXParserFactory; a factory specification is searched for as follows: 1. System property javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory 2. <java.home>/lib/jaxp.properties; property javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory 3. File META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory 4. The default: org.apache.crimson.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl Xalan currently supplies a file in the META-INF subdirectory (in xalan.jar) that contains åÊåÊorg.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl as its contents. Do people think we should eliminate the default or change it to the Xerces ParserFactory or leave it at Crimson; the way it is now. This discussion also applies to the DocumentBuilder Factory. If there is no opposition; I agree with Pat that we should change the default to Xerces. Gary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

78973,,,,,,,,Point taken. Migration query is following in this case 'Update person set username='rave2011.myopenid.com'; openid='http://rave2011.myopenid.com/&#39; where username='http://rave2011.myopenid.com/&#39;'. We can add such migration steps in release also with some migration.txt or in change log file itself. Ideas?,The reason I asked was that there may be deployed instances of Apache Rave that use a different backend (MySQL; Oracle). Simply throwing these databases away may not be an option. As community we should start thinking about how to handle upgrades.,[~jashajoachimsthal] The column existed already but for openid URL was in username column for openid user and openid column was empty. Now we are validating openid URL with openid column. Now a user can have his openid url also to login along with his regular username.,[~raminder] is the DB change: 'ALTER TABLE person ADD COLUMN openid VARCHAR(255) default null' ?,Applied the patch. Thanks Viknes. There is a change in DB so remove the h2 database file.,Added more test cases,I am able to find a solution for this problem. If you use always-use-default-target='true' in security:openid-login then the behavior is right. Now the issue is if user dont take any action then we have a temporary authenticated user( its just in memory not in DB) in the context and if user try to type http://localhost:8080/portal/ the above exception will come. To solve this problem we can create our own openid failure handler and dont create/authenticate temporary user. here is a example i found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12140519/spring-security-with-openid-for-google-not-working-in-production-environment,Working fine scenario: 1. Close all the open windows of a particular browser 2. Open a new one 3. Try loggin in as a new openid user and it works fine. It redirects the user to /openidregister openid user registration page. Not working scenario : 1. Close all the open windows of a particular browser 2. Open a new one 3. Login to rave as a different user/openiduser. 4. Logout the user 5. Now try loggin in as a new openid user The user instead of being redirected to /openidregister; is redirected to profile page. Since this is a new user; there would not be a home page for the particular user in the DB; we get a null pointer exception. So i would say even after logging out; something is retained in the browser cache by spring security (maybe or something else is the culprit). If anyone has a better idea of what the problem; pls share it.,This is the error stack.

58727,,,,,,,,Example RequestDocumentor output for the StatelessEngineTest,I have committed a prototype using a different approach in revision 1068442; where integration tests are enhanced with some metatada to generate RESTful API documentation. Will discuss on the dev list.,I think this should be given high priority (creating REST API documentation) for the whole system. It is at present impossible to get an overview of what IKS/Stanbol can do for you. As a result; it's difficult to work out what things are needed for a full IKS stack; let alone communicate the capabilities of IKS/Stanbol to others. So a definite +1 for anything that gets us to this documentation!,Jersey has builtin support to generate a WADL description of the HTTP service. I did not manage to get it working in fise but it should be possible. Would be good to generate the HTML documentation automatically though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Same goes for the sample project I submitted.
