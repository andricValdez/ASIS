When using WS-RM 1.1;åÊ the anonymous replyTo is not understood as such and is treated as an actual URL. When a CreateSequence message is sent; the response is of course never received; with an UnknownHostException. The debug log looks fine; in that the correct processing seems to take place.

21977,,,x,,,,,How about my comment at the end? 'Also; I'm suspicious of the logic for handling parent markup containers in AutoLinkResolver. It uses 'if' instead of 'while.' What if the autolink was two levels up in the inheritance hierarchy? I think that it should walk the parent links until it finds a null; not just check the first one.',,,,,
15698,,,x,,,,,I believe this is an issue. I have an action saveAction which I want to chain to editAction whenever there is a validation error. This is often necessary because a JSP will be displayed which has dynamic content such as a selectable list of items. However; if editAction has validation support; it will never be executed (even if it would validate successfully).,,,,,

19241,,,,,,,,I applied the patch. I'll experiment soon with another approach whether a page is stateless based on the generation of a callback url to that page. If there is at least one callback url to a page then it is stateful. It will be tracked in a different ticket. The last patch will stay even if the new approach works because it is a good optimization.,,,,,

10314,,,,,,,,First I want to verify that Gretchen's fix >Additional Comments From Gretchen Chiaramonte 2003-09-22 20:04 ------- for this bug works for me as well using Xalan 2.6.0. Second; regarding: >Additional Comments From Igor Hersht 2003-08-12 22:59 ------- ... >If I recall correctly we had such discussion before. >We consider that as a wrong usage. >The correct method would be to create transformer and >to do multiple transformations like >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); To help clarify what Gretchen has already implied; I believe that this doesn't complete the story. Xalan currently fails unneccessarily if 'xmlSource' is an XMLFilter chain headed by an XML source The XMLFilter chain should be reusable with only the source is refreshed. But at the end of the TransformerImpl.transformNode() call; the DTMManager is erased by the call to XPathContext.reset() as cited by Gretchen. This manager is what binds the XMLFilter to e.g. its stylesheet. Therefore; until this bug is repaired; the filter chain cannot be reused. That's a shame because I suspect that setting up the filter chain (eg reading the stylesheet from disk) is more work than constructing the transformer. In case it isn't obvious; a workaround re-creates the XMLFilter chain each time is it transformed. I did not find this bug report at first. Sorting out why I was getting a NullPointerException was a lot of work; partly because Xalan is built in to the JDK runtime but the 'endorsed' jar files are stored in common/endorsed under tomcat rather than JDK's endorsed (surprise ;-). In addition; Xalan has another bug in DTMManagerDefault.getDTM() (incorrectly returns the null this thread discusses) and one in TransformerImpl.run() (inappropriate throw calls). I will enter these as new bugs.,,,,,
71085,,,,,,,,Linked the API docs from the main navigation which completes this task for now.,,,,,
74032,,x,,,,,,Awesome. I actually did find two more non-code files - the readme docs in java/social-api/ and have added them as deletes to my client. Good to know it checks out with you though. Unless anybody objects I'll submit this relatively soon.,,,,,
18736,,,,,,,,You miss some logic: var e = Wicket.$(id); available++; if (e === null) { i.e. if there is an entry for a date picker in the DOM but there is no HTML element for it then the DOM entry is deleted too.,,,,,
12357,,,,x,,,,You are mixing runtimes. You must link _all_ executables with the same run- time library. For release; it's Multithreaded DLL; for debug; it's Debug Multithreaded DLL. Otherwise; bad things will happen when memory allocated from one heap is freed in another. I rebuilt your code with the appropriate setting; and everything worked fine. See the project settings dialog box; C/C++ tab; and the 'Code generation' category.,,,,,

15914,,,,,x,,,Oppss... sorry late reply.... Thx for handling this issue Claus. I prefered it to be the way it is now; document this behaviour as Claus already did. I think there might be both behaviour have its particular usage; if we want to have a param that is a string; it makes sense to use <param>...</param>; anything in between that's enclosed with %{} will be evaluated and its toString() called. On the other hand; if we want an object; we could used the value attribute. I guess what i'm trying to say is that both way of using param have their own usage. Of course this is just my 2 cents,,,,,
