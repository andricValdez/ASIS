I didn't change the jute - don't think this is a good idea; esp as also effects the java. Should be limited exposure since jute naming starts with caps. Also fixed a problem in zkfuse where previous changes to c client code were not reflected there (ie context passed to watcher).,Andrew could you take a look at this one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had a similar thing recently and not all servlet containers we're affected - it depended on whether the container filtered the output from the exception: åÊåÊåÊhttp://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsXssVulnerability As a workaround in the meantime you have a few options: 1) Configure a Struts exception handler 2) Configure a custom error page for your servlet container 3) Have a custom LookupDispatchAction overriding the getLookupMapName() method: åÊåÊåÊprotected String getLookupMapName(HttpServletRequest request; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊString keyName; ActionMapping mapping) åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊthrows ServletException { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊtry { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊsuper.getLookupMapName(request; keyName; mapping); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ} catch (Exception e) { åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊlog.error('LookupDispatchAction error ' + e); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊthrow new ServletException('Error in LookupDispatchAction'); åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ} åÊåÊåÊ},(In reply to comment #2) > On second thought; I think we may want to mark this as INVALID depending on your > response.

Yes (in answer to your first question); the alert box does pop up. Sorry for not saying so implicitly originally. Yes; I could put validation on the form. That's a possibility which hadn't occured to me. It's not going to be trivial to validate the field though; since I'm using LookupDispatchAction; so the legal parameter values are in the application's resource bundle; and the corresponding keys are already in the Map used by the Lookup. So if I do write a simple validator; I'm going to lose the i18n abilities; and if I write a more robust one; then I'm reimplementing what LookupDispatchAction does anyway. And on top of that; it puts another requirement on the user (to explicitly write the validation). Wouldn't it be more robust to just not echo the dodgy value?,On second thought; I think we may want to mark this as INVALID depending on your response. This is not a problem with the classes; but with the lack of Validation. You should put validation on 'method' parameter - does Struts allow validation on parameters which are not explicitly defined in forms?,I'll write up a patch for this ticket over the weekend. Tommy; so did it cause the JavaScript alert box to popup?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

48885,,,,x,x,,,I'm working with Liferay 5.1.2 / Tapestry 4.0.2 and that patch did not work for me.

I know; thats not the ideal solution; but it works with Liferay.,Thomas; Please find attached a patch for this particular issue. It is a precise patch to allow for easy review. I have patched the Tapestry 4 I am using a bit more than just this. I am interested in your experience with T4 and portlets; in particular with respect to TAPESTRY-2548. Regards; Pieter Schoenmakers,Actually I'm facing the same Problem: trying to redirect to the Loginpage of my Portal; but I get the IllegalStateException. (getActionResponse().sendRedirect(myurl);) Could you please post your solution for me Pieter? Thanks in advance!,I've extended WebResponse to implement sendRedirect for a ServletResponse and ActionResponse; throwing for a RenderResponse. AbstractEngine.handleRedirect is fixed to invoke sendRedirect on the reponse. Works like a charm. Add a comment to this bug if you're interested in a patch.,Interestingly; redirection from within a portlet works (more or less) by doing a getActionResponse().sendRedirect('foo'). Any attempt by Tapestry to set render parameters in order to influence the next service invoked will fail. That includes the exception page triggered by the attempt to set render parameters. The only downside is the amount of litter in the log. The real solution is for AbstractEngine.handleRedirectException to be overridden for the situation in which we're handling an ActionRequest. In that case the sendRedirect of the ActionReponse should be invoked instead of the forward of the WebRequest (which does the wrong thing for absolute URLs anyway). I am becoming disappointed in Tapestry-4 and the way it is maintained. A bug like this should not remain open for 2 years (minus 3 days). I know moaning does not speed up the bug being fixed but at least the moaning may be noticed. I'll probably fix the bug myself anyway. Add a comment to this bug if you're interested in a patch.,I'm sorry; I forgot to say about environment. I've tried run portlet in pluto 1.0.1 and jetspeed-2.1-dev. But result is still the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THRIFT-1883 did not apply so I thought to do this first...,On what? This is worthless without THRIFT-1883. GObject Introspection requires you to annotate the code (see https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Annotations) so it knows things like when to transfer ownership; parameter direction; generic container types; etc.; and in order to do that you have to use GTK-Doc style comments. This could be used without THRIFT-1882; but if that's going to happen it makes much more sense to do it first. That said; I'm actually having second thoughts about this (and THRIFT-1885). I'm in the middle of writing a new implementation (see http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/thrift-dev/201303.mbox/browser for some of the reasons why); and I'd rather use the Thrift namespace for that instead of c_glib. I could change the namespace on this patch to something else (ThriftGLib; maybe); but if something better is coming I don't see much gain in exposing c_glib to other languages.,committed this: 0001-Move-typedefs-before-public-structs-to-work-around-g.patch please rebase second patch.,0005-THRIFT-1879-Add-GObject-Introspection-support.patch This actually causes a GObject Introspection Repository (and a typelib) to be generated and installed; resolving this issue.

I should have added one; but have just had zero free time for months now ... Cheers; Nick.,The file I attached contains a tapestry project; generated with the quickstart archetype; that illustrates the bug. In short: There are two mixins: MixinBefore and MixinBefore2. In Index.tml; an 'any' component is given the mixins as: t:mixins='MixedBefore;MixedBefore2'. So MixinBefore is called first; and then MixingBefore2. MixinBefore's beginRender method returns false; this should short-circuit rendering of the body of the 'any' component; as diagramed in the component state diagram at: http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry5/tapestry-core/guide/rendering.html It will short-circuit it; but according to the last sub-section of the same documentation: 'Short Circuiting If a method returns a true or false value; this will short circuit processing. Other methods within the phase that would ordinarily be invoked will not be invoked. Most render phase methods should return void; to avoid unintentionally short circuiting other methods for the same phase.' This suggests that the MixedBefore2's beginRender method should NOT be called. So; in MixedBefore2's beginRender method; an IllegalStateException is thrown. If you start up the app; and go to the page; you will see that the IllegalStateException is thrown. As Nick pointed out; either the documentation needs to be fixed; or the code needs to be fixed; but they are clearly at odds.,Nick is right: the docs are pretty clear that subsequent methods in the same phase should be aborted; but they aren't; at least; subsequent mixin methods for the same phase aren't. I'll attach a sample project that illustrates the issue; generated with the quickstart archetype; so you can mvn jetty:run it.,This issue is not a duplicate of TAPESTRY-1805. In a nutshell; it's the answer to the following question: My component returns true for beforeRenderBody(). Should this prevent all other beforeRenderBody events from executing? If so; it doesn't; and is a bug. If not; the docs need to restate the short-circuiting functionality. Seems it's a bug is because of the comment next to the exception raised: åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// Given that this method is *only* invoked from code åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// that is generated at runtime and proven to be correct; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// this should never; ever happen. But what the hell; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// let's check anyway. Cheers; Nick.,Duplicate of TAPESTRY-1805.,Sorry; I should have given an example; but at the time I thought the bug was pretty clear. Here's what I posted about it to the dev list over 2 months ago: Subject: T5: Clarification on render phase component/mixin conflict behaviour Newsgroups: gmane.comp.jakarta.tapestry.devel http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.jakarta.tapestry.devel/20864/ Date: 2007-07-20 10:22:32 GMT (9 weeks; 1 day; 16 hours and 28 minutes ago) Hi. The component rendering guide suggests ordering and short-circuiting should prevent components and mixins using the same render phase from crossing swords; so to speak. Basically I've got a case where this doesn't seem to work out: AbstractField has a @Mixin DiscardBody. @Mixin DiscardBody returns false for beforeRenderBody(). (Note that @Mixin DiscardBody has a @MixinAfter.) My component derives from AbstractField. My component returns true for beforeRenderBody(). According to the docs I expect my component to short-circuit the phase and prevent DiscardBody's beforeRenderBody() from being invoked; but instead an exception is thrown. (Full stack trace appended below.) My expectation seems reasonable; especially considering the comment before the exception raising code; but which is correct? ;-) åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// Given that this method is *only* invoked from code åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// that is generated at runtime and proven to be correct; åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ// this should never; ever happen.

The current extend06.xsl becomes invalid right now. Joanne; you need to fix the testcase. Please close the bug when the testcase is fixed.,This patch exposed some problems for 1.0 stylesheets because errors were no longer thrown for unknown xsl elements. Another issue is the absence of fallback no longer throws an error. According to the spec; a fallback child is needed for instantiated; unknown xsl elements in forward compatibility mode or else an error is signaled. However; this does not apply to top-level unknown extension or xsl elements. Their contents are simply ignored. The testcase extend06 will have to be revised.,Patch was applied to Apache CVS head branch and xslt20-compiled branch by Brian Minchau. Not only does this patch for 'fallback' fix this bug it also makes ver01 ver05 ver06 and ver07 pass for the XSLTC conformance tests!,Created an attachment (id=8573) Patch for fixing fallback in xsltc,,,,,,,

Some parts of the Stat struct were getting repointed or overwritten by the time the values were shuttled into the Ruby glue. Aside from the variation between 32b and 64b; the variations were repeatable (always the same changes; always the same wrong data); so I thought I saw something that wasn't there. Properly duping the struct before passing to the Ruby thread resolved it.,Sorry; some of the data included is invalid. I'll repost when confirmed; if necessary. :-/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fixing tests is covered in SQOOP-397.,Integrated in Sqoop-jdk-1.6 #62 (See https://builds.apache.org/job/Sqoop-jdk-1.6/62/) SQOOP-354 SQOOP needs to be made compatible with Hadoop .23 release blee : http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/?view=rev&rev=1199149 Files : /incubator/sqoop/trunk/src/test/com/cloudera/sqoop/lib/TestLargeObjectLoader.java /incubator/sqoop/trunk/src/test/com/cloudera/sqoop/mapreduce/db/TestDataDrivenDBInputFormat.java /incubator/sqoop/trunk/src/test/com/cloudera/sqoop/testutil/MockObjectFactory.java,Here's an update to the latest patch that Tom posted. This makes Sqoop build. If you want to keep up with the latest versions of this patch check it out from Bigtop.,Apply SQOOP-354-0.23.0-SNAPSHOT.patch in addition to SQOOP-354.patch if you want to run against 0.23. (Not for commit.),Reviewboard: https://reviews.apache.org/r/2758/,It turns out that Mockito isn't needed; since MockObjectFactory was only being used by TestLargeObjectLoader; and then only to configure the output committer. I've simplified the test so that it doesn't use an output committer (since that isn't a part of the behaviour being tested); and now MockObjectFactory is no longer needed. Also; HadoopTestCase wasn't really being used; so I've removed that dependency too. The tests that I've changed work on both 0.20 and 0.23; so I think this change can be committed. Please review. Having a switch to build on either 0.20 or 0.23 should be tackled in another issue.,More precisely; the Hadoop test JARs are being published; but the HadoopTestCase class has not been moved to the Maven part of the build; so is missing from the test JARs. See HADOOP-7590.,Here's a patch to demonstrate the problem. Changing the Hadoop dependency to 0.23 necessitates an incompatible change to MockObjectFactory. This is similar to the changes covered in BIGTOP-162; and which are handled either via shims (an interface whose implementation is conditionally compiled according to the Hadoop target version) or via mock object libraries. Since the changes to Sqoop are only in the tests; using a mock object library is probably most appropriate. Are folks open to adding Mockito (say) as a Sqoop dependency? The other problem; not fixed in the patch; is that the Hadoop test classes (in particular HadoopTestCase) are not yet published to a Maven repository; so it's not possible to compile TestDataDrivenDBInputFormat.,Roman: have you tried excluding the extra transitive dependencies?,This is .23 related. The root cause as far as I can see is the Mavenization of Hadoop. Ivy gets confused because of extra transitive dependencies that it fetches from the .23 pom files.,Is this for 0.23 or 0.22?,A dep. problem?

3591,,,,x,,,,That is my understanding. Looking at the dtd; it only defines a type attribute (required) on the validator element; which doesn't make any sense for this file.,So validators.xml shouldn't have a DTD - is that correct? Matt,The problem is you shouldn't be using the dtd for this file. The validator dtd is only for actual object and field validations; not validator definitions. I've fixed the unit tests since it also thought it was to use the dtd.,I've seen this issue with both WebWork 2.2.4 and Struts 2.0.1.

discussed in the comments; this behavior can be customized in each deployment in the way that mostly matches the overall domain.,The purpose of 'enabled' is to inject a workflow variable into the running workflow instance so that it is up to workflow what to do with it: the default worklfow definition is just a sample. SyncopeUser.setSuspendend() is only called by the AbstractUserWorkflowAdapter as part of implementation of UserWorkflowAdapter.suspend() and UserWorkflowAdapter.reactivate(): its purpose is instead to check whether user has been suspended or not. In short: enabled is used to check whether the user is created as disabled or not; while suspended is used to mark an user that was already active but now is not any more. This difference comes into relevance when you consider that disabled users (not suspended) are not considered for propagation to external resources; while suspended users were considered; at the time they were active.,I created a Wiki-Page containing a sample workflow description and image; to show how updating of suspended users could be enabled: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SYNCOPE/Updating+suspended+users I replaced 'enabled' check in enableGW with 'syncopeUser.getSuspended()'. From my point of view this 'enabled' attribute is redundant and should be removed. I reviewed syncope core source code and as far as I can see; this attribute will always be (and stay) null; except if a new user is created by synchronization with an external system. But even in this case; I would rather call 'setSuspended(..)'; instead of using this 'enabled' attribute. If you agree with me; I could provide a patch fixing this behavior.,A common scenario for changing attributes of suspended users would be as follows: A new employee is announced for next month. A system administrator creates a new account for this new employee but keeps it suspended until the new (future) employee starts his new job. If any attributes (spelling issues; role assignments; ...) need to be changed before this user is activated; this would match this previously described usecase. And for me; this sounds like a rather common usecase. And yes; you might be right; that the default workflow needs to be changed for a production environment; but for people new to Syncope and just playing around with it; could be quite irritated why they get error messages when trying to change attributes of inactive users. Providing a default workflow capable of handling this; would prevent these kind of irritations.,I don't see any particularly useful or not useful allowing by default suspended users to get updated; hence for me this is a 0; customizing the workflow definition is in my experience one of major tasks to be accomplished in any IdM deployment; hence default workflow is likely to be changed anyhow. Consider that allowing suspended users to get updated could impact in propagation to / synchronization from external resources; especially when syncope user status is mapped to external resources' status: this only to say that your proposed change might involve some integration tests refactoring. Regarding your questions about 'enabled'; if you take a look at ActivitiUserWorkflowAdapter's source; you'll see that this variable is given as parameter to the create() method: this makes possible for caller to discriminate whether an user should get created as active or not. One can easily get rid of AutoActivate: it is there as commodity placeholder when more elaborated activation condition need to be defined. +1 for moving user-related classes under org.apache.syncope.core.workflow.activiti.user (thus preparing for org.apache.syncope.core.workflow.activiti.role for SYNCOPE-173),,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiwanka; thanks for your help in investigating this issue.,Ludger and Thiwanka; I agree with both or your assessments. This not only corrects an inconsistent state but is also minor performance improvement for checkNormalizationAfterRemove() when the first child of a node is removed.,I wrote a sample program to demonstrate the scenario described above. sample.xml : <?xml version='1.0' encoding='ISO-8859-1'?> <note> <to>Thiwanka</to> <from>Erangi</from> <heading>Apache</heading> <body>Xerces</body> </note> InternaRemoveChildTest class : import org.apache.xerces.parsers.DOMParser; import org.xml.sax.SAXException; import java.io.IOException; import org.xml.sax.InputSource; import org.w3c.dom.Document; import org.w3c.dom.*; public class InternaRemoveChildTest { public void parser() { InputSource is = new InputSource('/home/thiwanka/workspace/Test/src/sample.xml'); DOMParser parser = new DOMParser(); try { parser.parse(is); // System.out.println('The sample.xml is well-formed.'); Document document = parser.getDocument(); Node node = document.getDocumentElement(); System.out.println('Document Element node name : ' + node.getNodeName() + '\n'); System.out.println('\n___________________DOM nodes before removing the child___________________\n'); processNodeRecursively(node); removeNode(document); } catch (SAXException e) { System.out.println('The sample.xml is not well-formed'); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println( 'The parser could not check the sample.xml IOException' ); } } public void removeNode(Document document) { //Create the node to be removed - the first child in this specific case Node node = document.getDocumentElement().getFirstChild(); System.out.println('Node Name of the node to be removed : ' + node.getNodeName()); //Remove the node Node removedNode = document.getDocumentElement().removeChild(node); //Start debugging from this point System.out.println('Node Name of the node to be removed : ' + removedNode.getNodeName()); //Access the DOM tree System.out.println('\n___________________DOM nodes after removing the child___________________\n'); processNodeRecursively(document.getDocumentElement()); } public void processNodeRecursively(Node node) { for (Node child = node.getFirstChild() ; child != null ; child = child.getNextSibling()) { System.out.println('Node name : ' + child.getNodeName()+ ' ' + 'Node value : ' + child.getNodeValue()); processNodeRecursively(child); } } public static void main(String[] args) { InternaRemoveChildTest test = new InternaRemoveChildTest(); test.parser(); } } Note : Check the values at 'checkNormalizationAfterRemove' method in 'ParentNode' class.,Got to know that the checkNormalizationAfterRemove() method checks whether the adjacent siblings of the removed child are 'TEXT_NODE' or not. * In internalInsertBefore() in ParentNode.java; if the 'refInternal' is null the node is appended to the tree as the parent's last child having no reference to the nextSibling attribute(which means having the value null). In the above discussed issue @line 548; the value 'oldPreviousSibling' gets whenever the 'oldInternal' was a 'firstChild' is the last sibling. But inside the normalization checking process this inconsistency does not matter. The real values at the time of normalization checking should be (in checkNormalizationAfterRemove method in ParentNode.java) : previousSibling = null (normalized property is preserved) But the values actually passed in to checkNormalizationAfterRemove method are : previousSibling = lastChild; and lastChild.nextSibling is null (normalized property is preserved - using wrong values) So the checkNormalizationAfterRemove method gives the same result when the removed child is a first child. But I think; this inconsistency should be still addressed in the code.,What is meant by 'checkNormalizationAfterRemove(ChileNode previousSibling)' in org.apache.xerces.dom.ParentNode.java ?,@ line 547 and 548 in Class org.apache.xerces.dom.ParentNode.java: // Save previous sibling for normalization checking. ChildNode oldPreviousSibling = oldInternal.previousSibling(); Assuming the case that (oldInternal == firstChild): When it comes to this point the oldInternal.isFirstChild(false) is already invoked and now it is not available as the first child. When it was acting as the first child it contained null value in ChildNode.previousSibling. An; when it comes to line 548; it fails isFirstChild() (when calling oldInternal.previousSibling()). But the return value is going to be a null as well. At this point oldInternal.previousSibling() always return a null value once oldInternal was a first child && now it is not. So I think the code does have ant defect. Pls correct me if I have misunderstood the issue. Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18020,,,,,,,,r563181 pom.xml,r563179 Update: QNameTest.java QNameDeserializeTest.java AllWodenTests.java,Added a couple more patches - AllWodenTest changed to include the new QNameDeserializeTest class and pom.xml changed to exclude QNameDeserializeTest instead of QNameTest.,Dan supplied the patch; so assigning the JIRA to him.,Thanks to Dan Harvey for contributing a fix in file patch-item-137.txt,Background: According to the Java 5 javadoc for the QName class; the prefix field must be non-null. It must be specified on the 3 arg ctor and it should default to the empty space '' when using the 2 arg or 1 arg ctors. However; when a serialized QName object is deserialized the namespace; local name and prefix fields are set from the values in the serialized object. Before Java 5 the QName class did not have the prefix field. If an older (pre-Java 5) serialized QName object is deserialized by Java 5; the deserialization should detect that there is no prefix value and initialize the prefix field to the empty string. The Woden QName class does this by overriding the readObject method to check the deserialized object for a null prefix and set it to the empty string. The IBM Java 5 JRE also initializes the prefix to empty string when deserializing an older (pre-Java5) QName object. However; the Sun 1.5.0 JRE does not - it leaves the prefix field in the deserialized object as null; which contradicts non-null invariant implied by Sun's QName javadoc. Our attempts to get this fixed in the Sun JRE have been unsuccessful. So instead; we will extract the test method in question ; QNameTest.testGoodDeserializeQNameWithoutPrefix(); into a separate test class called QNameDeserializeTest and exclude this from the Maven continuum build. That way the remaining QName tests can be included with the Maven build (which runs at Apache on Solaris using the Sun Java JRE) without the deserialize testcase breaking the build. The new test class can be included with the Woden Junit test suite when perform regression testing separately to the Maven build.,junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Expected a null 'prefix' to be initialized to the empty string ''. at junit.framework.Assert.fail(Assert.java:47) at junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:20) at javax.xml.namespace.QNameTest.testGoodDeserializeQNameWithoutPrefix(QNameTest.java:476) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:585) at junit.framework.TestCase.runTest(TestCase.java:154) at junit.framework.TestCase.runBare(TestCase.java:127) at junit.framework.TestResult$1.protect(TestResult.java:106) at junit.framework.TestResult.runProtected(TestResult.java:124) at junit.framework.TestResult.run(TestResult.java:109) at junit.framework.TestCase.run(TestCase.java:118) at junit.framework.TestSuite.runTest(TestSuite.java:208) at junit.framework.TestSuite.run(TestSuite.java:203) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.junit3.JUnit3TestReference.run(JUnit3TestReference.java:128) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.TestExecution.run(TestExecution.java:38) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:460) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:673) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.run(RemoteTestRunner.java:386) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.main(RemoteTestRunner.java:196),I have just run this test against the Sun 1.5.0_12 JRE and the test still fails; so sun haven't fixed this yet.,,,,,,,,,,,

Only in the rare event of a yet unmapped ClassLoader it's going to be a bit slower. While the patch seems to work very well a second or third pair of eyes would be very well appreciated. This patch also contains changes by patch for WICKET-2875 and reuses an empty array (new Field[0]) for classes without any injectable fields.,cant we just copy the specific ConcurrentMap impl we need from google code and add it to our own package? Else we could just use a ConcurrentHashMap and then use WeakReference keys ourself (but then we need to make sure that we clean it now and then),It's not that we are completely against it; but we careful in adding dependencies. A rule which we treat more strict for wicket-core than subproject such as wicket-spring. But if there is a good reason to add a lib; we'll do. Since we are using maven; it's a clear benefit if that lib is available via a maven repository (such as http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/com/google/collections/google-collections/),OK. I've found another perf issue with @SpringBean. Switching back to a locator pattern (injecting beans into WebApplication bean only) improved throughput 5x @ 20 concurrent users. I am happy to help; but would need to understand your reluctance to use a 3rd party library; given the current perf impact. For the above; Google Collections' [MapMaker|http://google-collections.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/index.html?com/google/common/collect/MapMaker.html] looks like a solid fit.,Obviously with Inspector we can not simple replace Collections.synchronizedMap(new WeakHashMap()) with ConcurrentWeakHashMap since such a class does not exist. And we don't want to add a dependency on a 3rd party library just for that purpose. Since you seem to have all the tests and tools properly set up to validate; may be you could also provide a patch. I'm more than happy to apply it later on to the repository. Thanks for your help Juergen,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And those would probably be interested in seeing the background jobs - no matter where they come from.,TODOS removed in revision 1231129. Plugin made optional in revision 1231138; can be disabled by configuration. The use case for disabling the plugin is when background jobs are user-level operations: our plugin is good enough for admin-level background jobs; but for end users it's good to have a UI that's integrated with the rest of your system's user-level UI. That was the whole idea behind the JobConsole service; to be able to create customized consoles; in which case it can be good to disable the webconsole plugin to avoid confusion.,> It might also be good to make this plugin optional; in case users want to supply a custom variant. Why ? Isn't our plugin good enough ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70265,,,,,,x,,If I see it correctly; the current implementation creates a resource provider for each symlink - I fear what happens if there are hundreds or thousands of symlinks,I'm still not 100% convinced that a resource decorator couldn't solve the simple use case. I wouldn't go into merging or overlaying etc. just plain linking :) So; if you have resources /a/b1 and /a/b2 and symlink resources: /s/x1 -> /a/b2 /s/x2 -> /a/b1 Listing the children of /s gives you x1 and x2 - you could also have a non symlink resource /s/x3 there When requesting /s/x1 the resource decorator detects the symlink and returns a resource with the path /s/x1 but forwards all other methods to the resource of /a/b2. This of course works only for this level; so the question is just what a list children of /s/x1 returns or it is desired to allow deep links like /s/x1/bla/bli/blo which is then resolved to /a/b2/bla/bli/blo.,Here my naive two cent to this topic: Why not simply extending the existing JcrResourceResolver to make it recognizing sling:symlink (or so) node types and make it return the referenced resource instead of the requested resource. This way there is no confusion in what this feature does: using a resource at one location as a 'placeholder' for a resource at some other location. Here some use cases where this feature would come in quite handy: 1. Site Navigation: Creating views to the content tailored to requirements of certain groups of users. These views are comparable to database views with the exception that they are static: a subtree contains only sling:symlink nodes to build up the 'view'... 2. Reducing redundancy by reusing existing resources in a different context.,What I'm thinking is let's say... Node /b/bar has property text1='one' Node /b/baz has property text2='three' Node /a/foo has property text='two' Node /a/foo also has sling:overlayPath = [/b/bar; /b/baz] /a/foo.json will return { åÊ'text' : 'two'; åÊ'sling:overlayPath' : ['/b/bar'; '/b/baz']; åÊ'text1' : 'one'; åÊ'text2' : 'three' },@Justin > Any reason you couldn't have this be a multivalued property? I cannot imagine how that would work. Could you elaborate? Ok; thank you very much for the plentiful feedback! I'll take this through another iteration to incorporate your feedback. I'll drop the symlink idea in favor of the overlay mechanism. This should simplify the code a little and does make sense for me; since I don't have the symlink use-case at the moment. Unfortunately I don't have much time on my hands to work on this during my day job; so it may take a little while.,>> Just thinking out loud here; but how about *only* supporting overlays.

Ideas welcome :) > ... one more thing: for us to be able to use this contribution you should upload it with the 'Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works' button checked. Thanks. That's a mistake; I meant to check this of course. @Justin I agree that shareable nodes could be an alternative way to explore this. However; the use-case I need to cover is creating a language tree in a WCM scenario; which can be gradually overlayed with translated pages. So the 'with exception of overlayable' would have hurt.,with the exception of 'overlayable'; don't JCR 2 shareable nodes accomplish the same thing and have the advantage that the post servlet will work on all members of the shared set?,... one more thing: for us to be able to use this contribution you should upload it with the 'Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works' button checked. Thanks.,Looks interesting to me .... @Carsten: I don't think ResourceDecorator would help here; because this functionality really creates a virtual subtree in the resource tree root et the symlink resource containing the subtree rooted at the symlink target. Some comments to the patch: åÊåÊ* As for the symlink query: I would look for sling:symlinkTarget properties and not the node type. The node type is mostly åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊinteresting for applications/administrators but on an implementation level; the property is what we are interested in åÊåÊ* sling:overlayable: I understand the concept; but: can we come up with a nicer name ? ;-) åÊåÊ* The ResourceResolver field of the SymlinkManager should be private. Access to the field for the SymlinkResourceProvider åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊshould be possible using a getter method åÊåÊ* SymlinkResourceProvider.listChildren should probably support non-Symlink resources; particularly if the symlink overlay is åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊenabled åÊåÊ* As a convenience it would be usefull to add the rootPath to the service.description property of the provider service registration åÊåÊ* Not sure here: Would it make sense to have the sling:SymlinkResource type also extend sling:Resource ? åÊåÊ* How is the symlink resource accessible ? Symlink Resource Access: Provided you have a resource /content/symlink with a symlink target set to /content/target. Thus accessing /content/symlink would actually return you the /content/target resource; which makes perfect sense. But: How is the actual /content/symlink resource accessible ? For example; if we want to remove the symlink or if we want to retarget the symlink ?,Thanks for the clarifcation. > Then if /a/foo has property sling:overlayable=true > (in addition to sling:symlinkTarget = /b/bar) > /a/foo/4/text is 'four' Seems like this could be very confusing...if you really need it; I'd suggest making it configurable and turned off by default. IMO symlinks should mimic what happens in a unixish filesystem: if /a/foo has sling:simlinkTarget = /b/bar; I'd like /a/foo and everything under it to be the same tree as /b/bar.,@Carsten I didn't look into the ResourceDecorator mechanism; so I don't know if the same use-case could be implemented that way. But if you have input I'm certainly very interested. @Bertrand The example you gave is precisely what I had in mind and what the patch achieves. Additionally; extending your example; assume /a/foo/4 has property text='four' Then if /a/foo has property sling:overlayable=true (in addition to sling:symlinkTarget = /b/bar) /a/foo/text is 'one' /a/foo/4/text is 'four' /a/foo/4/2/text is 'three',> ...JCR content from the sling:symlinkTarget path is then exposed below the symlink node... Not sure if I understand this correctly; can you confirm that the use case is as follows? Node /b/bar has property text='one' Node /b/bar/4/2 has property text='three' Node /a/foo has property text='two' Then if /a/foo has sling:simlinkTarget = /b/bar /a/foo/text is 'one' /a/foo/4/2/text is 'three' Is that correct?,I haven't looked into your patch yet; but what about using a ResourceDecorator instead of a provider - this avoids all observation stuff etc.
20927,,,x,,x,,,woops; thought this was already fixed...,Here is a patch that almost work. The idea is that PageManager.touchPage() is called only in Page#onAfterRender() and before redirect in the case of redirect_to_render strategy. The runtime is OK but WicketTester has some problems; mostly because MockPageManager is dumb.,This is not fixed actually. I'll give a try on the approach with lazy getting the page id.,maybe we can make page#getnumericid() get the id lazily. usually if something does call page#getnumericid() the page is not stateless.,This id is get from the Session during page construction. It is not possible at this point to know whether it is stateless or not. Non-stateless component/behavior can be added to the page before render-time. This is even how trunk works at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

15073,,,,,,,,duplicate of WW-1598,From the mailing list: when the 'targets' attribute is set to a parent element of the form; and the link is hit; the content of the 'targets' element is set to 'Loading...'; the problem is that doing this will 'erase' the form in IE (duh). So when dojo iterates over the fom to build the parameters; the form is empty (form.element.length == 0) in IE; but in FF the elements are still there. So; when you have an scenario like this; you can't show the loading text. Now the bad news; there is no way to prevent the loading text from being shown; I created a ticket for it the other day with a patch; but it is scheduled for 2.1.0: https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/WW-1570,I was able to reproduce the problem! Not that I'm happy; but at least we are on the same page now,I am attaching an 'enhanced' index.jsp file. Links in different positions; with different targets; some of them using filter script. All these links do work and submit data with FF 2.0 I tried to use it with IE6 - this time IE does not even make request after clinking on any of these links. IE shows error message about missing tooltip script even just after loading - before any action from my side. I am still using snapshot 2.0.4 downloaded last weekend.,I have no access to that dev machine here; will try to answer this question in about 6 hours. But I am pretty sure I tried to make some variants of that sample and use 3 anchors: inside the form outside the form but still inside the parentDIV - formId set outside the parentDIV - formId set I am sure it still did not work; but now I am not sure if it still did not append params or if it failed to meke the request completely. I will verify it later today and send some comment here.,That's an old problem and has been there for a while. Shouldn't be related to the from submit problem. I have a question; if you move the submit button (or the anchor) outside the form; and specify the form using the 'formId' attribute; does it pass the parameters on the request?,I do not know if it matters here; I will copy some info from the users mailing list that I made last week. I am not sure if this is the problem; or at least a part of the problem; but I get it also on the simple test page attached above. Fresh browsers; cache cleared; refreshing with SHIFT (/esu is my app prefix). I was running the sample using struts 2.0.4 snapshot downloaded from nightlies on the weekend. /esu/ajax/index.jsp <--- location of the test JSP file /esu/struts/xhtml/styles.css /esu/struts/dojo/dojo.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/browser_debug.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/debug.js /esu/struts/simple/dojoRequire.js /esu/struts/ajax/dojoRequire.js /esu/struts/CommonFunctions.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html/Tooltip.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/widget.js /esu/struts/dojo/src/_package_.js /esu/struts/dojo/src.js /esu/struts/dojo/_package_.js Messages on the FireBug console under FF2.0 --------------------------- But I also get some 404s under FF: GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html/Tooltip.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/widget/html.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/widget.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src/__package__.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/src.js GET http://localhost:8080/esu/struts/dojo/__package__.js Could not load 'dojo.widget.html.Tooltip'; last tried '_package_.js' [Break on this error] throw _13||Error(_12); Message from IE6 ------------------------------ Could not load widget 'dojo.widget.html.Tooltip' last tried '_package_.js' FF reports errors on the console but submission works. IE fails and does not give much more info. I tried to instal the developer's plugin for IE; but it does not give much more info here.,I will try on different locales; I guess that's the only difference; I also have Windows XP (I tried on Linux also). What find strange is that the 'targets' is used after the request is made; so changing the target shouldn't affect how the request is made.,Since the weekend I tried to reproduce the issue using the above 2 JSPs on 3 other computers with IE6. The configuration is: XP SP2 with all recent patches; latest IE6. If it matters - the locale in use is PL. I have this problem for about a month; since I started using this way of submitting forms. Issue with my original JSPs (a bit more complex than the attached samples) was reproduced on several other; remote machines. All the time it works on FF 2.0; and does not pass params under IE (makes request but does not append params). I understand it's difficult to fight against sth that cannot be reproduced; but the issue is there.,I wasn't able to replicate this problem.,,,,,,,,,

And my data type parse show that all are in a string type. From this point of view; the normalize-space function is involute: string = normalize-space( string) If that I assume is wrong; you can't anyway explain the serial questions 2. Note 3: With Xalan 1.7; I think that the call of normalize-space break the search from the first three nodes <A><Rx><P><L l='d' t='d1'/>. This is the bug.,As I stated before; I tested your stylesheet with a number of processors; and they all produced the same result. There is no bug here. In the first case you think is bad; no nodes are selected. The normalize-space () function accept a string as a parameter; but you are passing a node-set. The standard XPath conversion is to take only the _first_ node of the node-set; in document order; and convert that to a string. The result is another string that has been normalized. In this case; the string value is 'd1'; and the comparison to the literal string 'e1' fails. The second case is similar. You seem to be assuming the call to normalize_space() using a node-set will somehow return multiple strings; and the = operator will use existential quantification and find that one of the strings matches the literal string 'e1'. Although that is how the = operator works with a node-set; it does not work that way with a function that accepts a string and returns a string.,- Add precision about system et executing files - Add bug_func.txt expected (if there is no bug) - I don't test with another functions (Only with normalize-space function) - There are incontrolled automatic wrap on file: = bug_func.xsl; tag xsl:value-of = 2xbug_func.txt (With bug working and ok) - Precision about system et executing files = The bug is working on Windows 2K and Windows 98 SE. = No bug with Xalan 1.5.0 and Xerces 2.2.0 on Windows 98 SE. - Precision about executing files = xalan Xalan version 1.7.0 Xerces version 2.4.0 ... = Dir of executing files: 14/01/2004 02:05 118ÌâåÊ784 Harness_1_7_0.dll 14/01/2004 02:04 1ÌâåÊ998ÌâåÊ848 Xalan-C_1_7_0.dll 14/01/2004 02:06 24ÌâåÊ576 Xalan.exe 14/01/2004 01:54 49ÌâåÊ152 XalanMessages_1_7_0.dll 02/12/2003 16:25 2ÌâåÊ490ÌâåÊ368 xerces-c_2_4_0.dll bug_func.txt expected (with no bug): @cas R1.a Ok:'f1'@cas R1.b not Ok (empty):'f1'@cas R2.a Ok:'f1'@cas R2.b not Ok (empty):'f1'@cas R3.a Ok:'f1'@cas R3.b Ok:'f1'@,Created an attachment (id=10232) bug_func.xml (test file),I ran your stylesheet using Xalan-C 1.7; Saxon 6.5.2; msxsl 4.0; and xt and got the same result using all four processors.

32383,,,,,,x,,Closing because this has been in RESOLVED state for over one year; if it turns out to not be fixed please reopen.,Added unti test for JavaPropertyValueObjectFactory in SVN revision 648256. Marking bug as fixed.,I've committed a fix to handle the extra exceptions in SVN revision 648251. The exception now looks like: org.apache.tuscany.sca.core.factory.ObjectCreationException: Failed to create instance for property intField with value at org.apache.tuscany.sca.implementation.java.injection.JavaPropertyValueObjectFactory$ObjectFactoryImpl.getInstance(JavaPropertyValueObjectFactory.java:226) <stack trace snipped here> Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: '' at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:48) at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:468) at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:497) at org.apache.tuscany.sca.databinding.impl.XSDDataTypeConverter.parseInt(XSDDataTypeConverter.java:771) at org.apache.tuscany.sca.databinding.impl.SimpleTypeMapperImpl.toJavaObject(SimpleTypeMapperImpl.java:280) at org.apache.tuscany.sca.implementation.java.injection.JavaPropertyValueObjectFactory$ObjectFactoryImpl.getInstance(JavaPropertyValueObjectFactory.java:224) ... 22 more,The cause of this issue is that the class JavaPropertyValueObjectFactory in implementation-java-runtime calls the simpleTypeMapper.toJavaObject() method which will throw NumberFormatException or IllegalArgumentException if the data it is attempting to convert is not valid. The fix for this issue is to add try/catch block for these two exceptions and make sure the Property name is in the exception.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65869,x,,,,,,,please apply these two patches in the $SMX4.0/runtime/trunk & $SMX4.0/nmr/trunk respectively. As Guillaume's mentioned above: Define a deploymentListener in the filemonitor module. Define a JBI artifactDeployment Listener for dealing with JBI artifact; to transform it to OSGified bundle automatically. With these two little patch; users can put JBI artifact in the deploy folder directly to install & start it.,Sounds good. I think it's better than having people run an offline tool. Though maybe we could add this transformation automatically somehow. I mean; we may want to support WARs too at some point; and we will have the same kind of problems. So we need a way to plug in some transformations inside the file monitor maybe (instead of having lots of different deploy folders). Maybe you could have a look at that ? I think we need to define an interface like: public interface DeploymentListener {      /**       * Returns true if the listener can process the given file       */      boolean canHandle(File artifact);      /**      * Process the given file (canHandle returned true previously)      * Can return <null> or a pointer to a transformed file.      */     File handle(File artifact);       }  This interface could be defined in the FileMonitor bundle and the OSGi deployer could register one. We could also add one later for WAR deployments. Thoughts ?,I'd like the 2nd solution; we can keep an separate directory for storing 'pure JBI artifacts'; and then if users want to deploy the JBI artifact; then just simply copy it to the JBI-specific folder; and that's all. JBI offline tool for users are transparent. I have following user scenarios in my mind. Users would use OSGi OBR to install the sharedlibrary & component from Gshell console. Users would deploy their own SA; and simply copy it to the JBI-specific folder. and that's all. Any potential problems or cons on this approach??,Good question. I'm not sure too. I'm not sure how we want to release the NMR / JBI. Right now; I'm thinking about a simple collection of OSGi bundles that could be donwloaded automatically from the ServiceMix Runtime. I'm don't know how we can handle the shell scripts this way... Maybe we could think of another way to handle that: the jbi bundles could start a file monitor on another directory; where pure JBI artifacts could be dropped and the JBI layer would handle the transformation to an OSGi bundle and install it through the OSGi api.,As I looked at the servicemix-runtime; I am a bit unsure where the offline tool should be; in the $SMX_runtime/bin folder? But this seems belong to the jbi compatibility; not the runtime. Or how to use the offline in the smx-runtime??,Update the patch according to Guillaume's comment.,Good work ! Still; I have a few problems with the patch: i can't launch the shell script on mac (haven't looked why yet) does it work on other unix systems ? If you don't have any available; i can handle that the tool only handles components so far; we need to also handle SLs and SAs by extracting the informations from the jbi descriptor if available or from the manifest if not the shell scripts includes the version number which is a really bad idea; as it would require manual editing before releasing. There are two solutions to that: just rename the jar 'convert.jar' or use the the maven resource filtering to put the version number at build time (i'd rather use the first one).,little polish on the offline.Main method. Add convert.sh/bat in the distribution; also package the offline.jar in the bin/ folder; actually; I am thinking may be we can add another folder called 'lib' for storing bin's depened library?? The offline doesn't seem to fit the 'system' folder; which will be installed as OSGi bundle by default.,,,,,,,,,,,

11773,,,,,,x,,Triage: Not for Xalan-J 2.2. We still need to evaluate this in light of Gary's point: exactly what location should we report for result tree events in this kind of situation? I'm not sure we intended to set the locator in this particular situation. Also; if we never set the locator; then we're still following the SAX spec - while this is somewhat useful; it's still an optional feature.,Just classifying bugs as Keywords:APIBug == bugs that pertain to specific API calls or advanced usage of Xalan.,Better bug categorization: API/programmatic problems versus stylesheet execution/output creation problems.,MyCH is being called for result tree events. These are nodes that are being built by the transformer on the fly. What location would you like the Locator to show? Do you want to know the location information for the XSLT element (within cities.xsl) giving rise to this output element? You say that if you remove the XMLFilter; everything works properly. I can't tell from your posting what this new code would look like but I suspect it removes the transformer from the picture altogether and you are just receiving SAX events from the parse of the input cities.xml. This; of course; is a very different situation since your elements to content handler are coming directly from cities.xml and can be traced back to a location therein. Gary,Here is the program that produces this bug. Take any xml file and xslt file as input.

I was going to take the same approach. Longer term I think we want to add a write api to solrresource loader. If something came from the classpath; it would still be written to the conf area and later that would override a new read...,Here's a stab at fixing this issue.

Do we have a testcase where the invalid value is in an AVT?,When an exception is thrown; it is possible that the push is not called although pop is always called in the finally block. I will post a patch for this problem.,The correct spelling is 'descending' and that works for me. (sort03; sort09; etc. test it.) Then I tried sorterr02; which has an invalid value for the order attribute. I got the correct message; but I also saw a Warning: popContextNodeList when stack is empty! so maybe we should try single-stepping through some of this code. (I was using 2.4D1 in my tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4163,,,,,,,,No reply; closing.,I admit that you've got a point. On the other hand; the XML-RPC spec does neither allow to send custom elements (which might include the exception and be evaluated by the XmlRpcClient) nor does it attempt to specify the error messages contents. My personal opinion is: When in doubt; transfer more information. I'd leave this as it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10134,,,,,x,,,Brian; I understand what you say and specification about 'serialization' in XSLT not 'indenting'. As I saied before; indenting is just the thing that we easily see the structure and data of XML document. Xalan output is not easy to see that. The last; I think the example of non-whitespace characters is no relationship to indenting. non-whitespace characters must not be stripped; but whitespace characters could be stripped. Regards; Tetsuya Yoshida åÊåÊåÊåÊ,Tetsuya; a colleage of mine has this to say: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian; actually; the text you've quoted allows us to add extra whitespace between </b> and <c>. If whitespace stripping is on; and the set of whitespace preserving elements is just xsl:text; then both of the following would be correct serializations <?xml version='1.0'?> <a> åÊåÊ<b>b</b> <c>c</c> </a> <?xml version='1.0'?> <a> åÊåÊ<b>b</b> åÊåÊ<c>c</c> </a> because; when stripped of whitespace; they would both look like this: <a><b>b</b><c>c</c></a> åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊOne of the cases the text you've quoted was trying to restrict was the one in which there are non-whitespace characters involved. For example; when the following is serialized; additional whitespace must not be introduced between </b> and <c> <?xml version='1.0'?> <a><b>b</b>x <c>c</c></a> --------------------------------------------------------------------------- So this bug is still alive. Regards; Brian Minchau,Tetsuya; there is a specification about indenting. Unfortunately it isn't complete; or perhaps all that clear. One thing that is missing for instance is how to indent and what the indentation character should be (space; tab ...). But it does say something in section 16.1 of XSLT 1.0 ('XML Output Method') (http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt). Here is a bit of it: [[ The xml output method should use an algorithm to output additional whitespace that ensures that the result if whitespace were to be stripped from the output using the process described in [3.4 Whitespace Stripping] with the set of whitespace-preserving elements consisting of just xsl:text would be the same when additional whitespace is output as when additional whitespace is not output. ]] This extra whitespace between </b> and <c> is implicitly an <xsl:text> element with whitespace in it. The clause above in 16.1 applies; so we can't add more whitespace to the existing whitespace. The output of such an xsl:text element must be same as when indenting is 'yes' or when it is 'no'. If we add extra whitespace in this situation we can't tell later on if it came from indentation or from the xsl:text element. Regards; Brian Minchau XSLT Development; IBM Toronto,Brian; Thank you for your reply. I've confirmed that in.xml that you showed bellow was no problem. As you suspect; there is a little whitespace after </b>. There is no specification about indenting. In my opinion; indenting only make us see relationship between parent node and a child node easily. Following my opinion; in.xml that I showed should be printed as expected.xml that I also showed. In addtion; Xerces and IE are printed in.xml as expected.xml Regards; Tetsuya Yoshida,Tetsuya; I think there may be a little whitespace 'fluff' that I can't see in this bug report. I'm suspecting a little whitespace after </b> and before <c> Try your in.xml as this: ===== in.xml ===== <?xml version='1.0'?><a><b>b</b><c>c</c></a> =================== I'm thinking that this will indent just fine; in which case you have some whitespace in the file in the spot that I'm indicating.

When i try to simplify it to reduce size; it stops to crash because of different memory allocations sizes it goes through the other code branches.

But the issue is that; I might be having 50 or even 500 multi select boxes in my application depending upon the records in my database. If I implement reset method; I dont want to iterate each check box and reset it to a default value. Is there any way to reset all the multi select boxes to a default value; in one shot. As per your suggestion; I need to get the request parameters and compare their values with those of the multi select box selected options and reset it accordingly? My question here is; multi-selectbox A(String[]) is having a default value null. Once data is loaded from database A's value is {x;y}. If user unselects both the x and y in browser for this multi-select box then it is still showing the {x;y} in my Action class when I pass the values back to database. what I'm expecting is a null value for A. Please let me know how to resolve this. Thanks and Regards; Sreedhar. http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927?page=comments#action_37962 ] the request only if the checkbox/select is selected. If you dont unselect it; you wont get the key=value in your request. method of the ActionForm; reset the value for the array i.e. retaining previous values if none is selected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- URL: http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927 Struts 1 Affects Versions: 1.2 Family is the HTML for my element. size='3' ><option value='1'>ABC</option> selected='selected'>DEF</option> <option value='6' selected='selected'>JKL</option> value='9'>MNO</option> selected='selected'>VWX</option> selected='selected'>YZA</option> <option value='1111'>FFFFF</option> <option value='209'>TQPN</option> </select> database. If I re-visit the application and deselect all the options selected in this box; it is not reflecting to show empty list. I'm using a string array in my form bean to hold these values. the String array should be empty or null. But it is still holding the previous set of values. any other action(selecting other values or deselecting one or more by keeping atleast one value selected) it works fine. automatically generated by JIRA. contact one of the administrators: http://issues.apache.org/struts/secure/Administrators.jspa information on JIRA; see: http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75121,,,,,,,,[[ Old comment; sent by email on Mon; 2 Oct 2006 23:39:22 +0200 ]] Rahul; I'll fax it in tomorrow (I'm in GMT+1; soon midnight). Hallvard,Here is the procedure; just in case (helps if a project team member makes the JIRA upload request): http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-ibiblio-upload.html,The pnuts developer seemed interested (had already thought of) putting pnuts in a Maven repository; but has not yet commented on when it may happen. In the meantime; I'll work on the unit tests (I've already found and fixed a critical bug) and look at patches for the site documentation.,I can confirm receipt of your ICLA. Thanks for sending it in. Once pnuts is in the Maven repository; and a complete patch is available (ideally all related changes put together in a single patch file); we can make progress here.,Thanks. Reponses numbered same as earlier post: 3) The site sources are in the xdocs/ directory: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/commons/proper/scxml/trunk/xdocs/ You can submit patches to the site sources; see this page for more on producing patches in the appropriate format: http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/patches.html 4) Let us know how that goes. I will follow up and confirm receipt of the ICLA (will require a few days).,I understand the need for quality assurance and I hope I can provide the necessary level. 1) OK. 2) OK; I'll have a look at the existing ones and copy what I need. 3) Who'll do that? 4) I don't know; I'll ask the list (yes; I'm subscribed; it's fairly quiet; since pnuts is mature and well documentet). The ICLA was faxed 10 hours ago.,Thanks for your time and the changes. Few comments: 1) The addition of Javadocs has introduced @author tags. Commons SCXML code does not contain those tags; the only attribution is the list on the team page on the website. The tags will need to be removed before this gets into the codebase; if it is accepted. 2) There are no test cases. Please look at the test suite and provide some test SCXML documents using pnuts along with the JUnit test cases. 3) We will also need to update the site documentation (such as the section on contexts and evaluators in the user guide) at the same time. 4) Is pnuts in a Maven 1 repository somewhere? If not; we will need that to happen first (might involve pinging the pnuts lists; are you subscribed there?). Finally; please let us know when your ICLA is sent and we can come back to this ticket then.,Slightly updated PnutsEvaluator.,Supporting Context implementation.,The Evaluator implementation.,Could you also fill out an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) for this? That is here (the fax number is on the form itself; you can mail it in too if you want): http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt While it might seem like a barrier; its a one-time thing; and is needed for contributions such as this one which may contain new source files; for provenance and pedigree reasons. Let us know if you have any questions; thanks.,Thanks for your time and contribution; looks good. Additionally; it would be very nice of you if you could please: a) Add the ASLv2 license header to the file (see any other Commons SCXML file) b) Separate the Evaluator and Context impl in two separate source files (each with license headers; like the jsp or jexl packages) c) Remove any non Commons SCXML class references from the code d) Correct package name (suggest org.apache.commons.scxml.env.pnuts) e) Add Javadocs That would probably complete the contribution; IMO (barring anything I've missed here). Thanks again.,This simple Evaluator implementation adds support for using pnuts as the scripting language for SCXML. Note that the attached file implements a slightly modified Evaluator interface; where the newContext method takes an addition TransitionTarget parameter. However; this is not important for the actual implementation; as it is only used for caching the context for the purpose of other parts of my project. Similarly; there is a reference to and use of an additional class; ScxmlPnutsXswtRuntime class; that may be removed.,,,,,,
