"OK, thanks.The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want. When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same.When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c ""You, too, could be using RDTSCP!"". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.",1

"Hi Michael,thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)).Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist, because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check). Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like    ...        if (manager.getCopyNew()) {            int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length];            for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++)                fields[i] = i;            newInstance.pcCopyFields(pc, fields);        }   ...This solution works for my testcase.As an alternative you can modify (or add an additional) newInstance to copy the data.I have no real experience with OpenJPA. Perhaps there is a much better solution.",1

"I apologize for taking so long to get to reviewing this.This has some good elements but also quite a few problems.  Here are a few suggestions.1. The bindingGBeans do not need to know the name of the gbean they are getting something to bind into jndi from, they need a reference to it.  Similarly they do not need to bind a naming Reference, they can bind the object itself.  For instance, the connector binding gbean can do something like this:private final ManagedConnectionFactoryWrapper managedConnectionFactoryWrapper; // this is the reference to the gbean that gives us the connection factory to bind...//now it's time to bind the connection factoryObject connectionFactory = managedConnectionFactoryWrapper.$getResource();globalContext.bind(jndiName, connectionFactory);This is also going to affect how the builders set up the binding gbeans: they know the name of the appropriate gbean such as managedConnectionFactoryWrapper, since they just created it, so they need to use that name to set the reference pattern in the binding gbean.  The binding gbean will then get (a proxy to) the ""real"" gbean that it can use as outlined above.2. I don't see an implementation of a writable thread safe jndi Context, as dain pointed out you would need.3. The zip file consists almost entirely of irrelevant files and the actual source files do not all appear to be in the geronimo project structure.  This makes it extremely hard to figure out what to look at.4. Some of the code modifications (such as to ServiceConfigBuilder) appear to be test cases rather than production code.  It will be a lot easier to evaluate your work if you keep test cases and production code clearly separated as is done in typical maven projects.5. I think you will need to redo the openejb work after dain's reintegration of his container rewrite.Thanks!  Let us know if you have any questions about this.",1

The problem is: onCreate and onResume are executed before is, so at the point where we start the task, the refresh spinner doesn't even exist. Hence, it won't animate.

That means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in, leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an id to the last li, and make the width less, and see if that doesn't fix it. If so you need to make the #maincontainer wider.",-1

The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.",-1

Once I get everything cleaned up, I'll post the patch here; you'll probably find it to be entirely unsurprising.I think what I'll end up doing to allow user-configurable buffer size limit will be to add a setter method on Parser and AbstractDOMParser, something like setInputBufferSize().

In this second case, i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.        The sender converts the data from an internal character            representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII            representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver            will convert the data from the standard form to his own            internal form.Actually , according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII , for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.So I don't know ... Any way, this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode. ",-1

I running an exe from a .NET app and trying to redirect standard out to a streamreader. The problem is that when I do myprocess.exe >> out.txt out.txt is close to 14mb.

Is there a way to change the default stream reader for the Process object?,0

The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context.

Basically you ""register"" your classes inyour jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that.

"[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example, OutputStats is not completed abstracted out, as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though, and it would be appropriate to put into trunk, but these are not my decisions to make. With regard to public methods that were changed, I don't think most of them are a big deal, besides as Cheolsoo said, the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw, but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project. However, the change from JobStats to MRJobStats, while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user), could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.",1

There is an intent to have forwarding decisions (aka openflow rules) within a chain, too. It can be hardly done with netvirt, but easy if you have the policy handler (group based policy) onboard.

The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them.

"""with the transition to ORM all we should care of is the real identifiers of this class, which is id""  that's considered to be not true. Since we(at least I don't) do not know (yet?), which operations will be performed on entities, we cannot tell, what we have to compare. Namely, we have to know first, whether these entities will be processed also with unset id when stored in collections, if so, then comparing just ids spells crazy results. Usually it's recommended to compare some unique business id instead of or along with db ID. See Hibernate recommendation related to id generation / object identity.Ok, I'll regenerate equals&hashcode using these two fields.Note: this syntax is Java7 syntax, with direct field access, allowing comparing classes with their descendants (the last thing is necessary due to hibernate design).",-1

However, it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call, similar to getRecordIfStored, it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.3. Well, not swallowed exactly, but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize.

This way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata. It will make control flow a little more complex as you'll have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current, but i think it would encapsulate things a bit better.{quote}Yes, in general, all the split logic should be in LFR. I might pushed that code to BKAdmin because, I don't want to disturb admin key flow much, which will go through LFR.Now anyway, I moved that logic, still not disturbing BKAdmin key flows in anyway.Attached a patch, which addresses the comments.Also to give more confidence on split fragment scenarios, I have added multiple boundary cases for FragmentSplit.Thanks a lot, Ivan for your nice reviews!",1

"That's a bit of a philosophical discussion. I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range.One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. Thus, I like the idea of merely testing what we actually need, and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we don't need, that should fundamentally be a good thing(TM)!",1

"John: first off, i want to apologize for the *extremely* belated patch review ... I know i told you i'd try to look at this months ago, but ... yeah ... life tends to get in the way of patches.on the whole, things seem pretty good -- although you were still using an interface instead of an abstract class.  Having the main API for a type of plugin be an abstract class is an important mechanism to help future proof ourselves against possible additions we want to make the the plugin API in the future; if it's an interface we can't really change it once it's released (because we might break people Impls); if it's an abstract class, we can always provide a default impl for people.the biggest concern i have about this patch at the moment is that there are no tests, and no example configs, so it's hard to be sure it's even working at all :)here's what i see as the current todo list for this issue... 1) there are some legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors that need to delegate to the SolrCore to get indexReaderFactory ... perhaps we should have a helper method that decides which SolrIndexConfig to use based on the ""name"" ? 2) we need tests showing custom IndexReaderFactory getting used (even if it's just a mock IndexReaderFactory thatsets a boolean to show it's being used) ... this will also serve as a test that config syntax works. 3) need commented out example of using a custom indexReaderFactory in example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml 4) sanity check this against SOLR-465, make sure we aren't painting ourselves into a corner. 5) we should make IndexReaderFactory use the AbstractPluginLoader stuff and remove the guts of SolrIndexConfig.loadIndexReaderFactory.  It looks like we'll need to add a ""single item"" version of load to the AbstractPluginLoader to make that work well.#5 is something that can be done after this is committed, but 1-4 are pretty important.  If you can update the patch with some configs/tests i'll think about the legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors and try to figure out a good solution for them",1

If two hosts are configured without the multi-backend feature, you are absolutely right, the patch will not fail.Explanation, in that case:volume_host1=host1 AND volume_host2=host2So, as host1 and host2 are not equal, the test will success. This is why I introduced the ""skipIf"" in the case where the multi-backend feature is not enabled.In fact, perhaps there is a problem of definition of the test:- 1/ does the test has to test the multi-backend feature (so, if the feature is not activated, the test is simply skipped)- 2/ does the test has to be more general: whatever the multi-backend is enabled or not, the test should return something ""coherent""Effectively, in this patch, I went into the way n1.

We in the process of building an IOS app (it's yet to be launched). We are trying to implement Push Notifications as part of the build. We have set this up via Amazon SNS and have created and registered an app certificate for the app which contains push notification permissions. Basically we send the app message from Server code - it states that it has been published and it returns the message ID but the device doesn't receive anything. To clarify the device registers ok for remote notifications and returns a device token. Very frustrating! Does anyone have any tips?,-1

One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width.

Right now, one has to look in the TaskModule, then in the DynamicSet and find out that, internally, it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator() will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list.

"You're absolutely right, there's more work to be done here. I actually tried to go down that road yesterday, but it landed me in a rabbit hole.Problem #1: there's nothing in the data passed down the live migrations code path that refers to the image backend the instance's drives were provisioned with.Problem #2: driver itself doesn't keep a reference of Image object around, it uses a factory object to create a new Image instance every time it's needed. That's based on images_type, which means that creating an Image object here would be semantically identical to checking image_type directly, just with more code.I think this needs to go all the way to the Instance object that should encapsulate enough information about all its drives to make live migration decisions. Generally speaking, it should have a reference to the backend (name of image backend class?) and a dict with backend-specific information that can be passed to the backend's _can_live_migrate() method on the destination. In case of rbd, the backend then would compare fsid, or simply check if the rbd URL is accessible and writeable.As I said, a rabbit hole.",1

I have used .netTiers/CodeSmith at work and really enjoy the speed with which code generation gives you a clean working data access layer. The question is has anybody used any code generation with Mono? I am open to learning something like SubSonic or NHibernate if those work better with Mono. Thanks in advance for any help.,1

Been a very busy week -- just got some time this afternoon and evening.The attached ConfigurableSimpleHTTPServer.patch provides facilities to fully configure a SImpleHTTPServer for production use.  A new class HttpFactory is introduced that is  a) Configurable with the most commonly set parameters, like request core thread pool size, request socket timeout, origin server header, etc., and  b) Specializable to supply factory methods to override all the default classes instantiated by SimpleHTTPServer.  This is important to achieve things like a bounded request queue.The parameters are also all settable in axis2.xml as part of the http TransportIn config.All axis2 tests pass, plus I've updated my application with a custom specialization of HttpFactory that is heavily configured and it also works properly.I'd like to look this over again tomorrow, and test the axis2.xml feature (not tested yet), but wanted to post this first version now to get comments on the approach.Deepal, Dims suggested you might be the right person to look this over?  Also, Oleg, I'd appreciate any thoughts you have.The patch is against my local 1.0 repository, but I expect it will apply against the svn head since simplehttpserver patch applies against 1.0 (with different offset for the hunks in one file).  If there are any issues, I'll make sure it applies cleanly against svn head tomorrow.Thanks,Chuck",-1

"Some thoughts I had about this:Overall, I think it's a good idea.  Seems like it's not crazy to add and would have multiple benefits.  Logical striping across the L1 boundary is a simple solution to both proactively handle splits and reduce compaction times.Thoughts on this feature1. Fixed configs : in the same way that we got a lot of stability by limiting the regions/server to a fixed number, we might want to similarly limit the number of stripes per region to 10 (or X) instead of ""every Y bytes"".  This will help us understand the benefit we get from striping and it's easy to double the striping and chart the difference.2. NameNode pressure :  Obviously, a 10x striping factor will cause 10x scaling of the FS.  Can we offset this by increasing the HDFS block size, since addBlock dominates at scale?  Really, unlike Hadoop, you have all of the HFile or none of it.  Missing a portion of the HFile currently invalidates the whole file.  You really need 1 HDFS block == 1 HFile.  However, we could probably just toy with increasing it by the striping factor right now and seeing if that balances things.3. Open Times : I think this will be an issue, specifically on server start.  Need to be careful here.4. Major compaction : you can perform a major compaction (remove deletes) as long as you have [i,end) contiguous.  I don't think you'd need to involve L0 files in an MC at all.  Save the complexity.  Furthermore, part of the reason why we created the tiered compaction is to prevent small/new files from participating in MC because of cache thrashing, poor minor compactions, and a handful of other reasons.So, some thoughts on related pain points we seem to have that tie into this feature:1. Reduce Cache thrashing : region moves kill us a lot of time because we have a cold cache.  There is a worry that more aggressive compactions mean more thrashing.  I think it will actual even this out better since right now a MC causes a lot of churn.  Just should be thinking about this if perf after the feature isn't what we desire.2. Unnecessary IOPS : outside of this algorithm, we should just completely get rid of the requirement to compact after a split.  We have the block cache, so given a [start,end) in the file, we can easily tell our mid point for future splits.  There's little reason to aggressively churn in this way after splitting.3. Poor locality : for grid topology setups, we should eventually make the striping algorithm a little more intelligent about picking our replicas.  If all stripes go to the same secondary & tertiary node, then splits have a very restricted set of servers to chose for datanode locality.",1

"Vishal Kher to Benjamin, Camille  9:38 AM (54 minutes ago)	Hi Ben,I was going to open a jira after checking with you guys.With your solution won't we run in into the problem that Camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastZxid - 1? - Peer fails after taking the snapshot. The snapshot has applied lastZxid, which created a child znode. During recovery it will apply lastZxid, which will faill with NodeExists and we will increment the Cversion of the parent (after fix for ZOOKEEPER-1046). So creation of sequential znodes won't be be really sequential. This is probably acceptable, but should be clearly documented. If not, then from this bug, it looks to me that patch ZOOKEEPER-1046 was also not complete. We may need to conditionally update cversion. I think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots. It will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.I will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well.Thanks.-Vishal",1

"> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349> Would appreciate any feedback. I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads.Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases, I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it.I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).Of course, I'm a newbie, but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed), not with Click?Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice, but this one is not. Making it even more complex, is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.From what I saw, one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however, Click should remain very simple, otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility, so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ). I think like this, are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :).

"I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview (it's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps ""up"" button twice) next animation starts with ""jump"" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful.

"Eoghan, imho we can define this discovery specialisation only in several ways. The problem is that discovery is resource-based, so if we know we need to poll hardware.*, we know we need to use one of the ceilometer.hardware.pollsters, and this pollster contains the discovery to use. Basically we know about what to poll (via pipeline - and it might be even '*') before knowing how and where to poll from. That's why it's much easier to have the separation of the pipeline layer, not later. If we do not have this pipeline-level separation, we need some other trigger to use. It might be configuration option in the ceilometer.conf, but this means it'll be completely static thing (comparing with the fact we'll probably have dynamic pipeline in future). Probably (as I answered Gordon) there is the way of possibility of having some pipeline field like 'roles = compute' or 'roles = central' or without it (meaning both) separated from sources and sinks. Both of these solutions (roles in the pipeline or in the conf) look kind of ugly to me.... Do you have some ideas here? Any help will be really appreciated :)",1

"Thanks Dawid.bq. Yes, this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did, albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard  I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst  wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted, this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already, ehm, a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:Well... it's tricky.  First, I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data, eg inCount, newAddress, etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<Int,X>) I think?Second, the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading, ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack), and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading, and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord, write-non-ord, read-packed, read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).",1

"From the dev list, didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a clone of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB, if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory, your GC simply drives crazy  we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible, as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/_, which does heavily locking. In contrast, MMapDir is completely lock-free! Until there is no replacement we will not remove it, but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. Thats a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. Its currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it, the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before, so you can allocate a buffer thats better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy, as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index, it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput, add MMapIndexOutput, but not based on a mmapped buffer, instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap  both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot. The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences, sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole message on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs.....",-1

"Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like:""""""Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).""""""The PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST isn't directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I don't think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code).
