Another option would be to refactor to allow the code in question to be tested as a true unit test; rather than as a system test (we need to work on that in general in ZK).

This test is intermittently failing in my env. Please review and let me know if you have any suggestions. Check if we can proceed with committing the changes without test if we are not able to find out the actual problem. As I already mentioned; patch has been tested manually.,Hi Flavio; quorum always fails to start if we configure different election ports. Also; I already tried to adapt FLE Test to use Auth FLE but its failing randomly [May be due to UDP]. That was the reason for not adding a test. Patch has been verified manually by configuring different ports. Quorum started with no issues after fix. I will upload the patch including test case I've added. Please review and let me know what I'm missing. So that I can correct it.,On a second thought about it; if we get an NPE when using different ports; then perhaps we could adapt the FLE test to use AuthFLE and then be able to reproduce the problem?,The modification is minor; and I'm ok with committing it without a test. Does anyone else have an opinion? I was actually suggesting a general test for AuthFLE. We have no test exercising AuthFLE currently. If you have one; it would be great.,@Flavio : I failed to write a reliably passing test for this as this depends on UDP. Manually verified the patch. This causes no test failures.,Sure; go ahead and upload a patch. Having a test for AuthFLE would also be useful.,Thanks for the info Flavio. I really don't have a specific use case. We found this problem while exploring different features. I've a patch to fix this problem as I mentioned in earlier comments and currently verifying the same. Even if this is going to be deprecated we can't have a NPE. no? Please let me know if I can upload the patch.,Hi Laxman; We haven't been maintaining the AuthFLE implementation; and we have been talking about deprecating it for a long time. Do you have any particular reason why you'd like to fix it; like a use case; or you're simply exploring?,Following piece of code in AuthFLE class looks to be problematic.              for (QuorumServer server : self.getVotingView().values()) {                 InetSocketAddress saddr = new InetSocketAddress(server.addr                         .getAddress(); port);                 addrChallengeMap.put(saddr; new ConcurrentHashMap<Long; Long>());             }  We are populating the addrChallengeMap with same port all the times. Ideally; this should be              for (QuorumServer server : self.getVotingView().values()) {                 addrChallengeMap.put(server.electionAddr; new ConcurrentHashMap<Long; Long>());             }  Any other thoughts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks Jarcec!,+1. I diff'ed CombineFileInputFormat.java from Sqoop and Hadoop-2.0.x and confirmed that there is one change as follows: 154c160;163 <     return codec instanceof SplittableCompressionCodec; --- >  >     // Once we remove support for Hadoop < 2.0 >     //return codec instanceof SplittableCompressionCodec; >     return false;  As far as I understand; the only impact of this difference is that the compressed files won't be split even though they're splitable; which doesn't have any impact on correctness while it does on performance. I didn't run any tests with this patch; but given that the patch is identical to what's committed in MAPREDUCE-1597; I think that it is fine. Please let me know if anyone has any concerns. Thanks!,We're using CombineFileInputFormat implementation that was copied over from Hadoop namespace to Sqoop namespace to retain exactly the same behavior across all supported Hadoop platforms. It seems that this issue was already fixed upstream in MAPREDUCE-1597. I'll try to port new version to our code base.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

927,,,,,,,,The patch no longer applies. Abmar; can you take a look?,I think we should move this out to 3.5. Am ok with committing this (after review ofcourse) to trunk as soon as 3.4 branches out.,Your plan sounds reasonable to me; Mahadev. I have reviewed this patch some time back; and I'm happy to review it again if necessary.,camille/flavio; I am also a little hesitant to add this to 3.4. Can we do this: Ill cut out a branch this weekend and then we immediately check it in into trunk to make sure we get this into 3.5? 3.4 seems to have quite a bit of features and we'll need some effort to stabilize 3.4. Any more features will just increase our effort to stabilization of the release. What do you guys think?,Well; I finally got the rb updated with the latest diff. I am willing to be one of two reviewers for this; but I am definitely not comfortable signing off on such a large change by myself (and note that I am also rather blind to whitespace issues despite my best efforts). If one of you is willing to also do the final review; I will deal with checking it in; doc generation; etc. https://reviews.apache.org/r/483/,Should we keep this issue marked for 3.4?

After some investigation; I have noticed that; with the patch applied; the server threads take longer to be released in the tests. I have measured the time that the QuorumPeer.join() invocations take on the QuorumBase.shutdown() method; and it seems that most of the time difference relies on these invocations. However; I am still trying to find out what is causing these threads to be delayed. I need to investigate it further.,Thanks; Abmar. It looks good to me. I have one quick comment; though. Is there any configuration value that could be causing tests to run slower? I have the impression that tests are running slightly slower with your patch. One in particular that called my attention was QuorumZxidSyncTest:  Trunk: [junit] Running org.apache.zookeeper.test.QuorumZxidSyncTest     [junit] Tests run: 2; Failures: 0; Errors: 0; Time elapsed: 94.55 sec  702: [junit] Running org.apache.zookeeper.test.QuorumZxidSyncTest     [junit] Tests run: 2; Failures: 0; Errors: 0; Time elapsed: 139.985 sec  and this seems to be pretty consistent.,Updated with trunk. Fixed the standard deviation calculus in the InterArrivalSamplingWindow.,Hi Flavio; Thanks for the comments. In this patch I have removed the normal distribution option for the PhiAccrual; and also the math-commons dependency in the ivy.xml file. With this modification; the PhiTimeoutEvaluator (and its implementations) are no longer needed. I also have refactored some of the common code regarding the ping sampling window. This made the code of the adaptive FDs clearer. Regarding my last experiments; I will post the results on the wiki asap.,Hi Abmar; Thanks for the addition to the patch. I was wondering if it is really a good idea to have both options; normal and exponential; implemented. Since your experiments have shown that exponential performs better; why don't use it only? Also; I was wondering if you have posted expertimental numbers showing that exponential performs better. In the case we go with exponential only; then we don't need the modification to ivy.xml; right? And last comment; it doesn't look like the classes implementing PhiTimeoutEvaluator need to be public. Is this right?,After making some more experiments with the Phi Accrual; I have noticed that the exponential distribution fits the ping inter-arrival sampling window better. Then; I have added a new option for the PhiAccrual called 'dist'; that is the distribution used to model the inter-arrivals. Two possible values for this parameter are 'norm' and 'exp'; and the default is 'exp'. When we set the PhiAccrual to use the exponential distribution; it will work similar to the Cassandra's failure detector.,Patch applied cleanly for me. I ran the tests and they all passed. I did notice that java test time for me moved from ~18 minutes to ~28 minutes. I don't think we should hold up this patch for this; however going fwd we should think about how to enable a quicker 'commit test' (run by devs before submitting/committing) as well as longer running hudson & integration tests. Where the commit test runs more quickly (hopefully < 10minutes). We will probably need to use something like junit test category support. Nice job; thanks.,Fixed the issue on the patch generation that Flavio mentioned.,I forgot to mention that the patch does not apply cleanly. I had to delete the first two lines (generated by eclipse); but once I did it applied cleanly. Abmar; could you upload a new patch? My +1 still holds...,+1; I'm pretty happy with the patch.,Thanks for the feedback Flavio; I have fixed the issue you mentioned. Only the new quorum hammer tests were not working propertly; they were creating the default failure detector in all the test cases. This patch addresses this issue.,In the previous comment; hopefully it was clear that I meant to say that the new tests are NOT working as expected. Apologies for the typo.,Thanks for the updated patch; Abmar. The new tests; however; are working as expected. More specifically; the methods in QuorumBase (createLearnersFD and createSessionsFD) are not being overridden as expected; which affects all new hammer tests. I haven't checked the other tests; but I suspect they suffer from the same problem. I'm canceling the patch for now.,1,I thought I had replied to your comment on the 13th; but it seems not. Looking at the code again; the way you did the factory is good. I misunderstood how zookeeper handled configuration.,In this patch: Replaced 'heartbeat' for 'ping' in the forrest documentation Revised javadocs Expanded the hammer (client and quorum) and recovery tests to exercise all failure detectors implementations. Flavio; I have run the tests you mentioned and they seem to fail in the trunk also.,Hi Abmar; I believe my comments from Aug 18 have not been addressed. In particular; I still see the same javadoc issues and no test exercising the failure detectors with a running ensemble. I believe the default failure detector is naturally exercised in various tests; but it would be good to have tests that also exercise the other failure detectors in a running ensemble. Isn't it right? There are still several references in javadocs and in the documentation to 'heartbeat'. Should we replace them with 'ping' for consistency? I'm also seeing some tests failing; like ObserverTest and NioNettySuiteHammerTest; but I'm not sure if this is related to this patch. I will explore a little further.,Hi Ivan; thanks for the feedback. I thought the idea was to declare an alias to a custom failure detector; so setting its options would be more user friendly. e.g.: sessionsFD = myfd sessionsFD.myfd = com.softwaresoft.zk.myFailureDetector sessionsFD.myfd.blahblah = foobar sessionsFD.myfd.myoption = barfoo In this case; I need both className and fdName parameters in the factory code (and this is how it is implemented in the patch). What do you think?,Code looks good Ambar; good job I think the factory code could be improved slightly though. Currently if you want a custom FD you pass in a FDname and an FDClass. I would merge these two; so that you only pass in FDname to the factory; and the factory can decide whether this is a builtin or a custom. So as an example; FDname can be fixed; chen; phiaccrual or com.blah.foobar.MyFailureDetector. When the factory sees this it goes... if (fdName.equals('fixed')) { fdClass = FixedPingFailureDetector.class; } else if (fdName.equals('chen')) { fdClass = ChenFailureDetector.class; } else if (fdName.equals('bertier')) { fdClass = BertierFailureDetector.class; } else if (fdName.equals('phiaccrual')) { fdClass = PhiAccrualFailureDetector.class; } else if (fdName.equals('sliced')) { fdClass = SlicedPingFailureDetector.class; } else { fdClass = Class.forName(fdName); },In this patch: Added support for declaring new failure detectors; as Ivan suggested. Updated documentation to reflect this. Replaced all 'heartbeat' mentions in the API and tests for 'ping'.,ZooKeeper-702 and ZOOKEEPER-823 both patch ClientCnxn,Cancelling patch until comments are addressed.,+1 to changing the API to use either ping or heartbeat only. I prefer ping because it is shorter.,One more comment on the API. Ping and heartbeat seem to be used interchangeably though it's my understanding that these are fundamentally the same thing.,I think putting it under the fd.classname would be most accessible for users. For example; fd.myfailuredetector = com.softwaresoft.zk.myFailureDetector fd.myfailuredetector.blahblah = foobar fd.myfailuredetector.myoption = barfoo etc... Then when the factory tries to instantiate a myfailuredetector and it sees that myfailuredetector isn't a known type it should look up 'fd.' + 'myfailuredetector' in properties; and instantiate the class with fdOptions as a parameter. Let the implementation take care of which options it wants to read from fdOptions.,I this patch I have addressed all the issues Ivan and Flavio raised; but the reflection code on the FaiilureDetectorFactory; in which I am working. What do you think is the most user-friendly way of configuring the failure detector? (using reflection on the FailureDetectorFactory). Should we require the fully classified class name in the fd.classname option and the parameters should be like fd.param1; fd.param2...? In this sense; should we force the failure detectors classes to have methods like setParam1(String param1); setParam2(String param2)...?,Hi Flavio; As we are using inter arrival times and a flexible sampling window; it can work the same way of Chen's estimation in both cases (j >= n or j < n).,Thanks for the comments; Ivan. I particularly agree with your point on building a list every time. I was actually wondering if there is any other important performance penalty we might be introducing. I can't think of any at the moment; but it be good to keep it in mind. The use of hbReceived and appMsgReceived does not bother me because they make more explicit what they do; but I agree it is more flexible the way you propose. Abmar; I went back to the papers and contrasted your implementation against the proposed algorithms. The only issue I could find is that the Bertier approach computes EA differently when j < n. I suggest we follow their description. The others seem fine to me.,Hi Flavio and Ivan. Thanks for reviewing the patch and posting feedback. Ivan; totally agreed with your suggestions; I have already been thinking about some of the issues you have raised also. I will address the issues you have mentioned and will update the patch asap. By the way; I would like to thank the ZooKeeper community for such opportunity; it was a very enriching experience for me; not only as a developer but also as a researcher. And I plan to keep on contributing to ZK community _x0089_ÛÒ as I have talked to Flavio previously; next steps include some more experimentation on the failure detection methods to better characterize them; and writing some guidelines regarding their usage and their appropriateness for certain scenarios/deployments.,Hi Abmar; The code looks good. Excellent job! I have a few comments about the API. API: Ping and Heartbeat are used interchangably. There are heartbeatReceived & appMessageReceived and pingSent & appMessageSent. In the actual implementations these do the same or very similar things. It would make sense to compress them into one api; and have the type of message received/sent specified by a parameters. Whats more; if a new type of message comes along; the failure detectors will already handle it without each needing to have their code updated. void messageReceived(String id; long now; MessageType type); void messageSent(String id; long now; MessageType type); The getFailedObjects and getObjectsToPing are used to return lists; which in all but one case have contains called on them once and are then discarded. I think these would be better as: bool isFailed(String id; long now) bool shouldPing(String id; long now) So that: a) You don't construct a list which is going to be discarded very soon. b) The internals of the FailureDetector are better hidden from the user of the API. In fact; shouldPing could be discarded and getTimeToNextPing(String id; long now) == 0 used. release should be releaseMonitored to make it symmetrical with registerMonitored. General: The failure detection factory could use newInstance to create arbitary failure detectors. So after if (fdName.equals('slicedhb')) fails; you could check if fdName is a fully qualified class name; and if so find the class and create a newInstance. This way its possible to add a failure detector without having to modify the zookeeper code. There's a lot of duplication in the javadoc for the Zookeeper class. A lot of this could be eliminated by using the @see directive. FailureDetector.java L131; typo; pint instead of ping.,Great job so far; Abmar. I'm thoroughly reviewing the patch; and I'm not done yet; but I have I few comments that you could consider addressing: Please revise javadocs. Many of them have typos and incorrect information; e.g.; the phi accrual javadocs refer to the Bertier fd; In ZooKeeperMain.java (-259;9 +279;21); you should perhaps have a more informative message when throwing an IllegalArgumentException. You could; for example; list the current fd options available; The tests included do not exercise the failure detectors with a running instance of the system. Instead they only check a few invariants of the failure detectors. We need to test that we can run an ensemble of servers with each of the failure detector implementations. You could use (or extend if necessary) QuorumBase or QuorumUtil to run an ensemble with each of the failure detectors. You could then kill the leader while executing operations and verify that eventually a new leader emerges and regular operation is resumed.,Ignore that; something strange happened when I downloaded.,I've just attempted to apply ZOOKEEPER-702.patch against trunk and it doesn't works. The patch seems to be a delta against a previous patch. Could you generate a patch of everything against current trunk?,I have updated the wiki page with the results of the experiments: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/GSoCFailureDetector,In this patch: Fixed a delay in client heartbeat sending; that was causing unit tests to run slowly. Added a new parameter to phi accrual FD - the minimum window size to begin timeout adaptation. Added a moderation step to Bertier FD; to comply with second level task described in his paper. Made Chen's alpha parameter configurable; and not a quarter of the timeout. Removed ^M characters from the patch lines. I also have splitted the patch in two parts: one containing the failure detector module source code (ZOOKEEPER-702-code.patch) and another containing the documentation (ZOOKEEPER-702-doc.patch).,Abmar; A few comments: Unit tests are not running properly for me. It is running very slowly and I'm not sure what's causing it. It looks like you've been running on Windows. It would be good to also test on a Unix platform. I'm on MacOS 10.5.6; Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-9M3165); We don't have changes for the C client; right? We need make sure that the documentation says that the C client must currently use the default detector and open a jira to fix it; Please consider splitting the patch into multiple files to make it easier on other folks to review your work.,In this patch: Added forrest docs Modified some initialization parameters of the algorithms,I was thinking of adding a new parameter to the adaptive methods; that is the minimum window size to begin performing timeout adaptation. As we noticed; adaptive methods can get benefit of a large window size; and there can be premature false suspicion if we do not know the behaviour of the network. In this case; the methods will start using a static timeout until the window reaches a certain size. What do you think?,Synchronized patch with updates from trunk Put all changes from subtasks together in the this patch,In this patch I removed some tests modifications that were not intended to be committed.,Sure Flavio; you are right. When I said that failure detectors rely on the assumption that TCP guarantees massage delivery and in order; I meant that the fds are not concerned about these issues. I have not implemented any ordering (or loss) treatment from the original algorithms; which do not rely on any protocol. Again; thanks for the feedback Benjamin. Doubts and suggestions are always welcome.,My understanding is that the failure detector is supposed to behave as an oracle that simply says dead or alive for each monitored process. The application on top; in this case ZooKeeper; decides what to do with that information. Followers and leaders will most likely use it differently. Your point about TCP is excellent; Ben.The way I see it the lost packets won't be observed for the failure detector; and they will end up translated into jitter due to the retransmissions; assuming they are retransmitted. Is this right; Abmar?,In this patch: Refactored SessionTracker and Heartbeat tracking on learners. Fixed an issue concerning server recovery. Patches of the subtasks use this patch as a baseline.,Hi Benjamin Thanks for your feedback! Regarding your first question; a failure detector is intended to determine when monitored objects are to be pinged and when they are supposed to have failed. So; you can have two different failure detectors running in two sides of the application; or you can have the failure detector in just one side; and the other side just replies the pings messages. Summarizing; a failure detector implementation is absolutely responsible for one side of the monitoring. Concerning your note; the failure detectors I have implemented rely on the assumption that zk (TCP) guarantees massage delivery and in order. To see the effects of the new failure detection methods; we are planning to do some experiments in the next week. We can also check if there is any effect of TCP in the adaptive fds behavior.,hey abmar this looks pretty cool. i think it will make the code much more clearer when we get this in. i'm wondering about the asymmetrical nature of the current zk fd that you've already mentioned: one side is generating traffic and the other is responding. shouldn't that be reflected in the interface? it is a bit confusing when parts of the interface are used on one side and parts on the other. on a separate note; i'm wondering if our use of TCP affects the failure detector. since TCP automatically handles lost packets; we aren't going to lose packets like we do with UDP based protocols.,In this patch: Learners report clients heartbeat sample information (mean and standard deviation) to Leaders.,Hi Diogo! Thank you for indicating this paper; I haven't found such failure detection type so far; it is very interesting. It proposes a simple way of estimating heartbeats arrival times based on application messages. However it does require the attachment of sending times to all application messages (or at least the ones it will use to do the estimation); which is an overhead to message size. Anyway; with the separate failure detector module; it would be easy to implement a new Failure Detector that uses such data. So far; I have adapted the proposed failure detectors in order to compute the estimated next arrival time only when a heartbeat is received.,Hi! There is paper by Satzger et al. where it is described an easy method to use non-periodic application messages as periodic heartbeats. The paper is called 'A Lazy Monitoring Approach for Heartbeat-Style Failure Detectors'. I hope that is still relevant. Cheers; Diogo,As I was refactoring server-to-server monitoring; I noticed that Leaders cannot process the client session heartbeats received by Learners; once they only track the last heartbeat (or app message) received from the clients; in order to report to the Leader (LearnerSessionTracker). I am thinking of tracking the heartbeats (not app messages) received from the clients in the LearnerSessionTracker; so the Learners can send them to the Leader; and the Leader itself can do an adaptive monitoring on these clients too. What do you think?,In this patch: Adapted failure detectors to work on both client and server sides of the client-server monitoring. Refactored server-side code to use the FailureDetector interface. Created a new FailureDetector; which groups monitoreds by their tick time; similar to what the SessionTracking does. Made the failure detector (and its parameters) options of the ZooKeeper configuration file. Corrected indentation (spaces instead of tabs). Next steps are: As suggested by Flavio; create sub tasks in this Jira for: Experimentation. Refactor server-server monitoring to use FailureDetector interface and make it configurable. Forrest documentation.,Hi Flavio; actually I was talking about the client monitoring on the server-side (SessionTracking).,Also; doesn't the leader ping followers at regular intervals? (Leader.java:360),Here are a couple of comments: It sounds like we will have to sample the heartbeats instead of considering all of them. If we use all messages as heartbeats; then we may end up in a situation in which we have bursts of traffic interleaved with periods of silence. In such cases; the failure detector might get confused for some time when it transitions from burst to silence.Using the terminology of Chen et al.; I was thinking that we could take \eta and only consider one heartbeat for every period determined by \eta. In ZooKeeper today; we have such \eta for both client-side detection and server-side detection. Alternatively; we could simply work with the phi accrual detector on the server side for now; make sure it works; and then revisit the other two. The choice of an exponential distribution in the math commons implementation is curious. The original paper does assume a normal distribution; so I wonder why it uses exponential instead.,Ashwin; I have already taken a look at this library; as suggested by Adam; and my implementation for the Phi Accrual is pretty similar; it also uses the Commons Math. However it uses the Normal distribution; as stated in the original paper; instead of the Exponential one. What do you think about making the samples distribution a parameter of the Failure Detector?,The Phi accrual detector code is also available as a simple library - http://github.com/arosien/failure. Fairly simple if you use Commons Math.,Hi Flavio. What I was trying to say is that the algorithms (Chen; Bertier) assumes that heartbeats are sent in regular intervals. Once this is not the ZooKeeper case; I tried to adapt these algorithms to estimate the time between a ping is sent and a corresponding heartbeat is received. This worked well for the client side; but it is not appropriate for the server side. After thinking about this; I decided to adopt an estimation of the inter arrival times between heartbeats. I guess it fits both server and client sides of the solution. What do you think?,Abmar; I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. What exactly prevents you from performing an adaptive monitoring of the clients? If you can use regular intervals; then I would assume that you can also use variable intervals. Is this a problem with our current design or the one we are proposing for this jira?,While refactoring the server side of the server-client monitoring; more specifically the SessionTracking related classes; I realized that; once the servers do not ping the clients; and they also use app messages received from the clients as heartbeats; it is not possible to do an adaptive monitoring of the clients. Servers do not know the time a client sends a ping and pings are not sent frequently _x0089_ÛÒ only at idle intervals. I am finishing refactoring the server side code and I will force the use of a fixed heartbeat strategy for now. Comments and suggestions are welcome,Patch changes are: Created appMessageReceived() and appMessageSent() methods. These methods allow the Failure Detector to use application messages as heartbeats; which reflects the ZooKeeper case. Added command line options to configure failure detector method and its parameters. Unit tests expanded to comply with new methods. Enhanced javadocs for each Failure Detector implementation Added commons-math dependency to ivy.xml Next things to work on are: Adapt server side code to use the proposed FD interface Start experimenting,Added more comments to pseudo codes.,As discussed with Flavio; I am thinking of adding a new parameter called -fd to the client; which will determine the name of the failure detector to be used. In this sense; the parameters of the failure detector will have its name as prefix; for instance: -fd chen -fd.chen.alpha 10000 In the server side; these parameters are intended to be defined in the ZooKeeper configuration file. What do you think?,Sure Flavio; so it will take another step: Make failure detector method and parameters configurable by the user.,Three very quick comments; Abmar: 1- Please don't forget to add license headers to each one of the new files; 2- Please add javadocs; 3- I was wondering what the current plan is to configure which failure detector to use and the parameters of the failure detector. In the current patch; it looks like you're setting it directly in the code.,Agreed with what Flavio said about the second point. The application scheduling interval is; indeed; much lower than the FD pinging interval. Attached the implementations of all initially suggested FDs and their unit tests. Also have included the suggestions Flavio gave concerning package naming and method scope. Once the Phi Accrual implementation needs to compute the Normal Distribution cdf; I have used the math-commons API; however; it still has to be added as an Ivy dependency. So; before experimenting; there are a few steps that need to be accomplished: Create a receiveAppHeartbeat() method on the interface so that we can keep using zookeeper messages as heartbeats and analyze its impact and adapt it to each FD implementation Adapt server side code to use the proposed FD interface Add comments to pseudo codes Expand unit tests Enhance code documentation Add math-commons dependency to Ivy,Abmar; It would be nice if you could add some comments to the pseudo-code of each FD; especially for the variables and parameters; and also provide the corresponding references. On your first point above; it would be nice if we could keep using zookeeper messages as heartbeats. On your second point; I believe that the problem you're alluding to will exist in any implementation; since scheduling a message to be sent doesn't guarantee that it will be sent right away. Is there any different issue you're seeing here that I'm overlooking?,Once ZooKeeper guarantees delivery order; I can ignore the seq field in heartbeat and pings messages. Now I am implementing the methods on the interface I proposed and two issues came to mind: ZooKeeper uses application messages as hearbeats; so actual pings and heartbeats are used only at idle states. The proposed methods must be adapted to consider this scenario. Regarding that a single thread is being used for the app and the FD; there is a delay between the time a monitored must be pinged and the time it is actually pinged. The impact of this delay in the FD QoS must be analyzed.,Attached the pseudo-codes for the failure detectors I have proposed. It seems I need to include the heartbeat sequence number in the receiveHeartbeat method of the FailureDetector interface in order to implement some of these FDs.,Hi Abmar; I was wondering about FailureDetectorStatus. It might be cleaner to separate getStatus into two separate calls; each call for each of the data structures you're currently returning on FailureDetectorStatus. I was also thinking that a shorter package name might be better; and it might be also better to have it under zookeeper. I was thinking about something along the lines of: 'org.apache.zookeeper.fd' or 'org.apache.zookeeper.fdetector'.,This patch proposes a first version of the FailureDetector interface. Its implementations are intended to run in the same thread of the application. Also; I have implemented a simple failure detector based on the ClientCnxn class and adapted this class to use this FD implementation. This is a preliminary patch; just for analysis and feedback; it is not intended to be committed.,I have updated the wiki page for this (http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/GSoCFailureDetector); including a discussion on whether there should be another thread for failure detection. I have previously discussed it with Flavio in order to raise benefits and drawbacks of including another thread in the application and we are expecting feedback to make this decision.,Henry; I'm not seeing the applications on the gsoc site. Can you add me as appropriate? So that I can see the applications I mean.,Also submitted GSoC project proposal for this.,Submitted GSoC application for this. Looking forward to feedback. Btw; link to HDY04 is broken; found this work only with google.

But the issue is that; I might be having 50 or even 500 multi select boxes in my application depending upon the records in my database. If I implement reset method; I dont want to iterate each check box and reset it to a default value. Is there any way to reset all the multi select boxes to a default value; in one shot. As per your suggestion; I need to get the request parameters and compare their values with those of the multi select box selected options and reset it accordingly? My question here is; multi-selectbox A(String[]) is having a default value null. Once data is loaded from database A's value is {x;y}. If user unselects both the x and y in browser for this multi-select box then it is still showing the {x;y} in my Action class when I pass the values back to database. what I'm expecting is a null value for A. Please let me know how to resolve this. Thanks and Regards; Sreedhar. http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927?page=comments#action_37962 ] the request only if the checkbox/select is selected.

This is how some browser behaves. You get key=value in the request only if the checkbox/select is selected. If you dont select or unselect it; you wont get the key=value in your request. In your reset method of the ActionForm; reset the value for the array to null.

The last; I think the example of non-whitespace characters is no relationship to indenting. non-whitespace characters must not be stripped; but whitespace characters could be stripped.

6447,,,,,,,,See bug 5694 for the DOMException problem.,It looks like the performance improvement in Xerces 2.0.0B4 might actually be a bug. Most of the time in Xerces 1.4.4 (or in Xerces 2.0.0B3) is spent in appending chunks of text. With the large number of entity references; those parsers (in the non-deferred DOM case) receive a chunk of text between entity references; then a predefined entity reference; then a chunk of text between references; etc. Each of those chunks is appended onto a single TEXT_NODE. In Xerces 2.0.0B4 the AbstractDOMParser is creating an ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE for each reference to a predefined entity and TEXT_NODEs for the chunks of text in between. This eliminates all of the overhead of appending. However; that behaviour is not permitted by the DOM API Recommendation[1]. As soon as we fix that problem; we'll be able to reproduce the performance problem in Xerces-2; so I'll update the product and version; and reopen the bug. I'm not sure whether we'll be able to do anything about it; though. I was also able to reproduce the DOMException with j_caesar.xml that you mentioned; I'll open a separate bug for that. [1]: http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core- 20001113/introduction.html#ID-E7C30824,I can't reproduce the DOMException - given the fact that you only parse document and don't make any DOM modifications; this error does not make much sense.. (I've run the testcase using the test program you've provided and dom.Counter sample). I am not sure we can fix the performance bug in Xerces 1.4.4 - all Xerces developers now work on Xerces2. If you have any patches for Xerces 1; you are welcome to submit those. Thank you!,- I did not use deferred DOM. Using Xerces 1.1.3 - The j_caeasar_escaped.xml document takes 82528ms to parse - The j_caesar.xml document only takes 611ms to parse. Using Xerces2 beta4: - The j_caeasar_escaped.xml takes only 420 ms to parse; so the problem seems to be solved in this version :) - The j_caesar.xml document causes the following exception to be thrown: åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ[java] org.w3c.dom.DOMException: DOM001 Modification not allowed åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ[java] at org.apache.xerces.parsers.DOMParser.parse(DOMParser.java:190),Created an attachment (id=973) Zip file with test case (java source and XML docs),1.

33264,,,,,,,,Assign to 1.0 during tidy up prior to 1.1,I think that this is now fixed. Individual top level composites are assembled separately; and resolution of cross composite references is left to the responsibility of the particular bindings. This new design; by not trying to establish in memory model pointers between independent composites; removes the issues that we were seeing before when we had these pointers in place. In other words; we do not need to update these pointers anymore when independent composites are added/removed/updated; because these pointers do not exist anymore :),Huang; I agree that we need to re-resolve existing components but I'm not sure that this needs to be done in a separate thread. What did you have in mind with threading? For now; I have added support for incremental building of an SCA domain; with the ability to build a domain; add a composite to it; rebuild the domain. The newly added components will be able to target component services already in place in the domain. If my proposal for incremental building (committed under revision 558740) suits everybody's requirements; we should be able to follow the same pattern to add support for: 1. invalidating components that are wired to component services being removed from a domain 2. handle composite updates by doing a remove + add 3. handle composite updates in a less disruptive way as long as the component services that they contribute do not change,åÊåÊåÊåÊHow about re-resolving the original and newly added components in a seperate thread; and replace all the old components when the resolvement is done. åÊåÊåÊåÊMy rough thought is: Clone all the components; and do the rewiring work in the cloned compnents; but keep all the implementationProvider/bindingProvider/scopeContainer refer to the same instance to keep their states unchanged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
