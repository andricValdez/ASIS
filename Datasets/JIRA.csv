Yes please - pull request away my friend!,1
If someone wants to take this over that's cool - I'm unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though.,0
It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life though.,0
Yes exactly -- sorry to be so unclear.,0
I'm not sure what the problem is but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.,0
Sorry for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm!,0
Sorry I thought submit patch was the way to attach a patch.,0
I don't have very much experience on branch0 would you like to take a shot at the port?,0
Especially I don't know very much about the test framework differences.,0
I will figure out the details and do the port later this week if you don't get to it first.,0
sorry unassigning myself from this backport.,0
Another backport (for a different jira) of mine is failing and I want to see if I can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport.,0

I've tried something similar (I removed the handlers and kept the readers) but the performance was not visible.,0

I should have been very careful before doing this.,0
My bad forgot to include the test file in the patch... Resubmitting in a second. ,0
*sorry*,0
Damn.,0
Git is tricky that way.,0
Sigh I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere.,0
Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase.,0
You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.,0
This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time.,0
Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side....,0
I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through.,0
"Sorry Chris

I missed it done !",0

Oh I didn't consider one flow like after the edit log conversion immediately #store failed.,0
I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.,0
Aside from the job succeeding (it doesn't) what effect should I be able to measure (in order to see if this is doing anything)?,0
You misunderstood the response: StopFilter indeed did not change.,0
You would need to implement session resume; thats a whole new can of worms.,0
Sorry for a mess in uploaded files my connection got broken during first upload.,0

I was not aware of being required to call that method.,0

The patch should be relatively trivial but like I said I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not.,0

Oh I'm sorry I was unclear.,0
Sorry Jacques I'll upload another file.,0
I did it wrong this time.,0
Sorry I had attached an older version... let's try this one.,0
However I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it's work.,0
This is only a problem with exceptions from java.,0
Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think),0
