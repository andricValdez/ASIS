Employee3 x Dept1.employess=Employee3

1411121_1,,,,,,,,,"Here's another crack at this:

1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines."
1411121_2,,,,,,,,,"2) To get secure behavior for java routines, the customer has to explicitly opt-in."
1411121_3,,,,,,,,,Let's be vague about what that entails right now.
1411121_4,,,,,,,,,"3) If you do opt-in, then you get the SQL standard behavior:

   3a) Jar ids are mandatory."
1411121_6,,,,,,,,,"Instead, to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database."
1411121_7,,,,,,,,,3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.
1411121_8,,,,,,,,,Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.
1411121_9,,,,,,,,,Then we defer to the system class loader.
1411121_10,,,,,,,,,"3d) At runtime, when we invoke the routine, we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file.

389675_6,,,,,,,,,"Also, the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns, which are search side."
389675_8,,,,,,,,,"My filterCache stats are great- you know it's set to 64K but right now, with almost all the RAM used up (we're at 71.9% now), but it's only using 36290 entries at the moment and it's holding pretty steady there(even as RAM usage increased by 10%)."
389675_9,,,,,,,,,None of the other caches have gone up much either.
389675_10,,,,,,,,,"We have no cache evictions, at all, but a 99% hit ratio."
389675_11,,,,,,,,,The sizes may be higher than you need then.
389675_12,,,,,,,,,They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info.
389675_13,,,,,,,,,"I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but, its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM."
1171432_1,,,,,x,,,,Yes exactly -- sorry to be so unclear.
1171432_2,,,,,,,,,Just really wondering/hoping you'd be interested in working on these ??

Collator object is already available in the territory sensitive character classes and we
do not have to go to database context to get it."
1379857_5,,,,,,,,,"I changed the code to use that collator

1563411_7,,,,,,,,,IncomingStreamReader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there's an enclosing 'try catch').
1563411_8,,,,,,,,,The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies.

I'm confused by this."
698238_2,,,,,,,,,"My assumption is that, when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file, that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache."
698238_3,,,,,,,,,(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.)
698238_4,,,,,,,,,"So, if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call."
698238_5,,,,,,,,,"In general, one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead, and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant."
698238_6,,,,,,,,,"An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead, but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks."
698238_7,,,,,,,,,"This can require 1MB or larger buffers, so isn't always practical."
698238_8,,,,,,,,,"So, back to your statement, a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o, but nor should it incur extra physical i/o."
698238_9,,,,,,,,,"It does incur extra system calls, but uses less memory, which is a tradeoff."

149095_1,x,,,,,,,,Thanks Pat.
149095_2,x,,,,,,,,Patch looks good to me.
149095_3,,,,,,,,,Ill go ahead and push it.

"
1046439_1,,,,,,,,,I applied the patch at revision: 599008.
1046439_2,,,,,,,,,"Still, why do we hardcode these numbers, e.g."
1046439_3,,,,,,,,,"port/src/lil/em64t/pim/m2n_em64t_internal.h:
#ifdef _WIN64
const unsigned m2n_sizeof_m2n_frame = 120;

#endif

vmcore/src/util/em64t/base/compile_em64t.cpp:
// Stack size should be (% 8 == 0) but shouldn't be (% 16 == 0)
const int ALIGNMENT = 0;

Doesn't it worth to let compiler calculate such values? "
924133_1,,,,,,,,,It would be good if folks can use standard Java i/o idioms with Hadoop.

{noformat}
OutputStream out = fs.open(...);
try {
  out.write(...);

}
{noformat}

When multiple files are involved the best thing is to nest the try blocks."
924133_3,,,,,,,,,"Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS?
"
1123551_1,,,,,,,,,"This looks good, but I wish there was a good way to set up a test case."
1123551_2,,,,,,,,,I guess the best way would be to create a JobTracker and call the heartbeat method and observe the requested heartbeat interval.
870799_1,,,,,,,,,I included the gen stamp and length in the {{cacheReport}} to handle caching newly appended data.
870799_2,,,,,,,,,"I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary, but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data, so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length."
870799_3,,,,,,,,,"Alternatively, I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data, but there are quota implications there."
870799_4,,,,,,,,,"On startup, I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated."
870799_5,,,,,,,,,I also agree that jittering doesn't matter as much if it's ticking on such a short time scale.
870799_6,,,,,,,,,I guess I could have cleaned this up rather than just changing the default cache report period like Colin asked.
870799_7,,,,,,,,,"However, since we want to eventually have both incremental and full reports, let's just ape how block reports work; don't jitter the incremental reports, but do jitter the start time for the full reports and afterwards tick at a regular interval."
870799_8,,,,,,,,,"Let's clean up all these issues in the incremental cache report JIRA (HDFS-5092); if this sounds good, I'll edit the JIRA description with these todo items."
597488_1,,,,,,,,,Uploaded a patch that fixes the comments and includes the test
1017255_1,,,,,,,,,Thanks for the review.

161056_3,,,,,x,,,,"You are going to kill me when I say this, but it seems like we should just commit your first patch."
161056_4,,,,,,,,,Because this neither-here-nor-there code-reuse seems not much useful.
161056_5,,,,,,,,,The original reason why i asked this is so that clients can seamlessly cross over like in MR between RM and AHS.
161056_6,,,,,,,,,But it seems like clients have to know which protocol they are talking to.
161056_7,,,,,x,,,,This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time.
305460_1,,,,,,,,,fully agree Christian!
305460_2,,,,,x,,,,"Sorry, probably a misunderstanding from my side...."
305460_3,,,,,,,,,"I refereed to the [^v1-enable-wall-werror.patch] which contains {{-Wall -Werror}} and I thought it sould be {{-Wall -Wextra}}

887647_3,,,,,x,,,,I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.
887647_4,,,,,,,,,Patch looks good to me.
691111_1,,,,,,,,,I'm fine w/ not naming it Consumer - I agree it does not really consume it.
691111_2,,,,,,,,,"But if we go with PayloadMergeProcessor, we'll need PayloadMergeProcessorProvider and they become quite long names :)."
691111_3,,,,,,,,,"I was thinking PayloadProcessor and PayloadProcessorProvider (have cool acronyms to PP and PPP), but then people might get confused that it processes all payloads (maybe before they are even written the first time), while it is actually invoked only during segment merges.I was following the *Consumer pattern I saw all over the place w/ SegmentMerger, and thought that if someone ever reads SM code, it will swallow easily another *Consumer one ..."

682430_1,,,,,x,,,,You misunderstood the response: StopFilter indeed did not change.

1725946_2,,,,,,,,,Only the first of these is a failure.
1725946_3,,,,,,,,,This test pukes all over the place when the first test fails.
1725946_4,,,,,,,,,Some of the other test cases in this class failed because that constraint error occurred?

Thanks for committing it."
991251_2,,,,,,,,,Anoop reminded me about this.
1061211_1,,,,,,,,,The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes.
1061211_2,,,,,,,,,"It is not well documented in MSDN, but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes."
1061211_3,,,,,,,,,"Some functions don't require it, but some do."
1061211_4,,,,,,,,,"A patch was made to the interpreter to fix this in assembly code, so if a native method has an odd number of arguments, additional 8 bytes are skilled by RSP to align it to 16 bytes."
1061211_5,,,,,,,,,Patch applied at 514264.
1017845_2,,,,,,,,,So I am likely going to work on this soon.
1017845_3,,,,,,,,,What is the exact problem?
1017845_4,,,,,,,,,"If it would as simple as just recreating ReplicationZookeeper or using RecoverableZookeeper J-D would have probably just done it :)
"
1463502_1,,,,,,,,,"You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code ;)

Also, it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length, and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue."
1463502_2,,,,,x,,,,"The patch should be relatively trivial, but like I said, I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not."
242894_1,,,,,,,,,The two issues mentioned by Tom has been fixed.

1537965_1,,,,,x,,,,"Done, sorry for all the mess on a simple patch."
534574_1,,,,,,,,,"David,

I've done a little digging and have a question around:  OrderReadHelper.getOrderItemQuantityBd()

Firstly going back a while now this log:
    http://svn.ofbiz.org/viewcvs/trunk/components/order/src/org/ofbiz/order/order/OrderReadHelper.java?rev=4367&r1=4281&r2=4367
shows a change to the strings that seems to make the first if statement redundant?!"
534574_2,,,,,,,,,I presume either that statement can now be removed or the original intention of the statement needs reimplementing?
534574_3,,,,,x,,,,"Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening, after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does ""ordered - cancelled = quantity"" which equates to ""1 - 1 = 0""."
534574_4,,,,,x,,,,"Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.
"
1575383_1,,,,,,,,,"scheduleAtFixedRate ""Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period; that is executions will commence after initialDelay then initialDelay+period, then initialDelay + 2 * period, and so on."
1575383_2,,,,,,,,,"If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed...""

so get() shouldn't be causing a cancel, but if an exception is found then we need to re-schedule it manually."
1575383_3,,,,,,,,,(If you cast the Runnable in afterExecute to ScheduledFutureTask you can get access to the scheduling info.)
1575383_4,,,,,,,,,if get is causing the cancel even w/o any exceptions being involved then I guess you'll need to source dive in ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to see what is going on.
405295_1,,,,,,,,,"Here are two thread dumps:

sling6.thread_dump.01.txt was taken about 10 seconds after a shutdown of Sling was attempted."
405295_2,,,,,,,,,sling6.thread_dump.02.txt was taken a couple minutes later.
405295_3,,,,,,,,,I include it because quite a few of the threads from the first dump have stopped by this point.
1098209_1,,,,,,,,,"thx todd, missed the ant/ivy stuff, update patch takes care of it (hopefully mavenized gridmix goes in soon and ant/ivy will go away)"
1473227_1,,,,,x,,,,Please ignore attachment (id=6938).
1473227_2,,,,,x,,,,It was attached to the wrong bug.
581209_1,,,,,,,,,According to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6336 we can't use git for websites.
401935_1,,,,,,,,,"Thanks for the reference, I'll look into it."
401935_2,,,,,,,,,[~egli] - can you reproduce?
401935_3,,,,,,,,,"If you do, you'd stand a better chance of making a proper fix..."
564075_1,,,,,x,,,,"(back from holidays, so a bit delayed, but) I confirm Andrzej's suggestion -- a plain-text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example."

1326729_2,,,,,,,,,"It would be great, if you could work on it."
1326729_3,,,,,,,,,Thus assigning the issue to you.
1326729_4,,,,,,,,,Thanks.
528962_1,,,,,x,,,,"Hi Marco,

I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar, sorry for inconvenience."
528962_2,,,,,,,,,"I have uploaded the modified patch ""PartyCommunication.patch"" and it is ready for testing.
"
1672977_1,,,,,,,,,"This is the reverse side of ARIES 399, which dealt with a deadlock in ServiceRecipe."
1672977_2,,,,,,,,,"As mentioned there to fix the issues blueprint code that calls out to any kind of client code (reference listeners, service listeners, initialiser methods) should not hold the full BlueprintRepository lock, which allows deadlocks like the two observed."
1672977_3,,,,,,,,,Or at least the locks need to be much more fine-grained than locking the whole container.
1672977_4,,,,,,,,,I hope the first approach as the more general solution will work though :)
1702071_1,,,,,,,,,"Yeah I had a hunch it was a shutdown hook, kicking in at the same time."
1552294_1,,,,,,,,,"i modified the test class from HADOOP-6148 (bigger is better)

1500398_1,,,,,,,,,I fixed the build failures on 4.1 this morning.
1500398_3,,,,,,,,,I'm doing an automated test as well.
1500398_4,,,,,,,,,Will close this ticket if there are no issues.
870881_1,,,,,,,,,"FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #344 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/344/])
HDFS-5041."
870881_2,,,,,,,,,Add the time of last heartbeat to dead server Web UI.
1173673_1,,,,,,,,,The patch should be licensed to ASF for inclusion in ASF works.
1173673_2,,,,,x,,,,Sorry for the mistake.
460954_1,,,,,x,,,,Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job?
1537801_1,,,,,x,,,,First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.
1537801_2,,,,,,,,,Is that part of the test in question?
547122_2,,,,,,,,,"lifecycle management up to a separate container

Agreed, and my patch also contains a TODO for that."
547122_3,,,,,,,,,"Similar to all other plugins, the life cycle hook should be pluggable in a sense that you can deploy them e.g."
547122_4,,,,,,,,,in an OSGi container as a separate bundle.
547122_5,,,,,,,,,Instead of hardcoding the hooks we could introduce a LifeCycleHookProvider similar to ValidatorProvider we already have.
547122_7,,,,,,,,,"Subject.doAs tricks

Good point."
547122_8,,,,,,,,,"Though, we have to review that usage in general."
547122_9,,,,,,,,,I'll try the approach you suggested.

1410139_1,,,,,,,,,Thank you Ole!
1410139_2,,,,,,,,,Committed v2 patch to trunk with revision 508383.
1100055_1,,,,,,,,,Committed to HDFS-3042 branch.
1100055_2,,,,,,,,,"Thanks for the reviews, Bikas and Aaron."

646202_1,,,,,,,,,"

646202_2,,,,,,,,,Have you tried the standard maven untangling tricks like deleting ~/.m2?
1194263_1,,,,,,,,,We need to make this configurable before we can apply this patch to the trunk (unless i have misunderstood the effect).
1194263_2,,,,,,,,,The demo looks like it will be very useful.
1194263_3,,,,,,,,,Thanks Cyriaque.
223817_1,,,,,,,,,Form#maxSize is ignored now too.

182292_3,,,,,x,,,,Sorry again!
1163131_1,,,,,,,,,> Another thing: is the try ... catch good or bad?
1163131_2,,,,,x,,,,Our caller may not notice what happend right now.
1163131_4,,,,,,,,,I guess will be better not catch since until now was not being catched and will be good to propagate upwards.
1163131_5,,,,,x,,,,"Sorry for my poor review, didn't notice try/catch :("
1037240_1,,,,,,,,,v2 removes some dross included by misstack.
718497_1,,,,,,,,,"You could easily test if it is due to felix by switching to equinox, if the effects are still there blame it on pax web or dosgi."

1129306_1,,,,,,,,,Would a new configuration boolean 'fs.manual.shutdown' be adequate for your needs?
1129306_2,,,,,,,,,"You could programatically set this before getting your filesystems, and when set true, the shutdown hook would not be added."
869031_1,,,,,,,,,"Vinay, thanks for working on this."
869031_2,,,,,,,,,"Some comments:

The new method added to Namesystem is better to
# pass BlockInfoUnderConstruction,
# call it as isInSnapshot, and
# do not throw IOException."
869031_4,,,,,,,,,"{code}
//Namesystem.java
public boolean isInSnapshot(BlockInfoUnderConstruction block);
{code}
In the implementation in FSNamesystem, it should try-catch the UnresolvedLinkException and log it as an error since the full path obtained from a file should not have unresolved link."
869031_5,,,,,,,,,Second question: Why adding DFSTestUtil.abortStream(..)?
869031_6,,,,,x,,,,It does not look very useful.
639696_1,,,,,,,,,I appended the information to the end of the file.
795428_1,,,,,x,,,,"Oh, I'm sorry, I was unclear."
795428_2,,,,,,,,,"You have the ability to add users to the mina group in svn, not to the group on people.a.o."

520683_1,,,,,x,,,,"Sorry Jacques, I'll upload another file."
520683_2,,,,,x,,,,I did it wrong this time.
238508_1,,,,,,x,,,"No idea about the issue resolution/if it's still active, but I'm afraid that by no stretch of the imagination can it be termed a ""Critical"" issue."

285534_1,,,,,,,,,thx to Cristi Toth  for his patch
309130_2,,,,,,,,,"Pull out the RopeTransport stuff, fix the bug, and add in the graceful degradation and I'm happy to see it pushed :)"
1470935_2,,,,,x,,,,"Sorry, I had attached an older version... let's try this one."
1470935_3,,,,,,,,,I guess it's OK to put it in trunk.
1470935_4,,,,,,,,,I did not write it in a way that fits in with the rest of the implementations though.
1470935_5,,,,,,,,,No unit tests either yet.
1470935_6,,,,,x,,,,"However, I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it's work."
1680512_1,,,,,x,,,,This is only a problem with exceptions from java.
1680512_2,,,,,,,,,"*, regular business exceptions work."
189914_1,,,,,,,,,+1.
189914_2,,,,,x,,,,Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think)
908493_1,,,,,,,,,Everything timed out.
908493_2,,,,,,,,,Resubmitting and making it a blocker for 0.22
1560034_1,,,,,x,,,,"Sorry, I kind of forget about this one."
1560034_2,,,,,,,,,I'm good with the last version of the patch of just adding a dclocal read repair chance.
1560034_3,,,,,,,,,Do you mind rebasing Vijay?
1014768_1,,,,,x,,,,I don't have strong opinions about it either way.
1014768_2,,,,,,,,,So I went ahead and made the change.
1014768_3,,,,,,,,,It's uploaded here and on review board.
160613_1,,,,,,,,,Removed version-infomation znode.

1665696_4,,,,,,,,,"So instead of the expected ""java.lang.RuntimeException: foo"" text being sent you get ""org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo""."
1665696_5,,,,,x,,,,The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.
1665696_6,,,,,,,,,GenericData.getSchemaName instead throws an AvroRuntimeException so the special handling of UnresolvedUnionException in Responder.respond is skipped and the nested exception text is the result.

356317_1,,,,,x,,,,Sorry for the spam - but which test method - can't find any related to the SnapPuller on trunk.

It should work after that."
1072532_4,,,,,,,,,I'll add a README
243701_1,,,,,,,,,"This is is my todo list still, but hasn't risen to the top."
243701_2,,,,,x,,,,"if someone wants to work on this please go ahead, I still plan to, just no time yet."
243701_3,,,,,x,,,,Sorry.
726893_1,,,,,,,,,Yeah we can do it in 0.8.1 which should happen fairly quickly after 0.8 but we are really trying to lock down 0.8 to critical fixes and this is more of a new feature (though obviously desirable).
726893_2,,,,,x,,,,Sorry for the hassle.
